i am 99,i have an interview tomorrow and  been 1 year since i've gone to one. yesterday they called and ask if i could come in thursday. which left only today to prepare.  i have not been practising at all.  i am just in constant panic mode.    i am just going to wing it and i am 99. 99 sure i am going to bomb it. even worse and  they want to conduct the interview and at a restaurant. ****. 
i am 30,i am 30+ and i am pretty much in the same boat as you having no job experience and all.  i've been trying to pick myself back up these past couple of months but it's been really hard with my current mental state. 
i am 29,that's weird and  i did really crave for a partner at 26.  now i am 29. 5 and recognize  it as hormones and i am just meh
i am 12,where i am 12 credits  = minimum to be full-time and  for student loan purpose.  other than that if someone doesn't need loans and  nothing's stopping them from doing less.  5 classes seem prefer a heavy load and  i am struggling with 4. 
i am 18,i know your pain.  we're in very similar situations and  you and i.   i am 18 and  turning 19 in may.  graduated high school last june.  my emotionally and physically abusive parents kicked me out of the house a month after i graduated.  i ended up moving in with my best friend and his parents.  i had just lost my job working the mall and  so that just made things worse.  i started going to a trade school for it and  but i realized that the school was basically scamming me and was for profit and am about to dump it.  i have an agreement with my rommmate's parents that i could live with them for a while and  until i found a job and could pay rent and  and in the meantime and  i could do house chores to contribute.   this was 7 months ago.   still no job and  i fucked up every interview i had and  whether because of transportation breaking down  and  oversleeping due to a shitty sleep schedule and  or just me not having any interview experience.  i have not applied to a job in a week and a half and  and they do not know.  i've burned myself out.  the only reason i even go to school anymore is because it makes it seem prefer i am working on getting my life together.   i know why this happened.  i know where i personally went wrong and  and where my parents fucked up in raising me and  and where the death is in the job market here.  i just can't do anything about it.   just prefer you and  i've lost all fucking hope and  and have consigned myself to being a neet for the rest of my life.  i have not moved onto the suicidal thoughts yet and  but honestly and  i am at a point where if a truck were to run a red light and be about to hit me as i crossed the street and  i would not make any efforts to save myself.  eventually i might just end it.  but we'll see.   at least i am going to get a battery of psychological testing done soon.  i am hoping i can get an aspergers diagnosis at the very least  and  and then hire a social security lawyer and try to get neetbux from that and  so that i can at least rest a room somewhere or smething.  but that's unlikely to happen. 
i am 20,i actually do not want anyone to kill themselves i was just ina bad mood yesterday and reading all these neet post pissed me off even more and  you are life is precious do not do it and being a neet made me a great musician i am able to learn stuff by ear even if i have not heard the song before and i know how to cover prefer hundreds of songs that is the advantage of neet you got all the time in the world i am 20 yrs old and i feel prefer its not to late to get a job and start fresh i really do not want to but idgaf anymore ima just go for it once i buy me a new guitar and amp/pedals i would feel very proud of myself and  they say money dosent make you happy but at least it makes you independent and gets you things youd never get as a neet and  anyway il update u guys once i get me a job i really do not want to but sometimes you just have to say fuck it haha
i am 18,meh i am prefer this.  i am 18 but still basically act prefer prefer an early teen girl.  i never really went through male puberty even though i started hrt at 16.  it's annoying to some people but others find it endearing so whatevs. 
i am 18,literally all i wear is skinny jeans an a couple short skirts and dresses for when i want to look more cute an feminine.  i dress  still even though i am 18. 
i am 21,this makes me feel so good.  i am currently on a list to get into an electrician apprenticeship.  i am 21 right now. 
i am 24,money   communicating daily activities   having to spend time with her friends/family  time in general  full disclosure: i've only had 1 girlfriend.  i am much more comfortable as a loner.  i am totally content being by myself.  i ended the relationship because i just did not care about her.  i only wanted a girlfriend to have had one and settled for the first girl to say yes. i am 24 and  kiss less until 20 and  sexless until 21.  have not had any intimate contact for last 2 years.  i do not whine or moan about it.  i am completely apathetic to it.  sometimes i think i may be asexual.  who knows though. 
i am 24,hey man.  i am 24.  had my first kiss at 20.   i understand that it sucks immensely when you hear about others having sex in high school.   do not be too hard on yourself. 
i am 6,good job man.  i am in a similar situation as you were. i am 6'2 and 250 lbs.  work out but never got my diet under control.   my most impressive feat is that i can do 8 dead hang pullups.  can't weight to reveal this muscle under here.  recently cut soda out and have been slowly shedding the weight. 
i am 25,as much as you do not want to believe it and  many people have been there.  life sucks.  some family's suck bad.   some people do choose to take their life.    *i've* been there.   here's a funny story on how i chose to help myself.  i told myself i've tried everything and nothing works.  i would watch tv all the time.  watch shows about people with shitty lives to make me feel just a little bit better.  my 600lb life is one of my favorites haha and     -me  and then i am watching it and frequently these fatties say      no you have not you fat fuck and  it's so obvious you have not tried everything because just look in the mirror.  and then it dawned on me that *i was just prefer that* but with my depression.  then i decided maybe i *have not* tried everything.    i found mindfulness and meditation about 5 weeks ago and ended up buying a book on it.  just reading the book was therapeutic and  but practicing the methods everyday helped even more.   i am still early in this journey and  i still get depressing and  self deprecating thoughts every day and days where i cry thinking about them and  but i at least defend myself against them now where i used to not.  i used to wish i could control my thoughts and now i can somewhat.  it's a big change.   relationships are not all they're cracked up to be.  i've been in one serious one where *i* ended it after about 3 months because i was only in it for the sake of being in a relationship.  that's no way to be.  that was 4 years ago and i am 25 now.  i've realized that i need to prefer myself first and for most.  do i? hell no! but it's a place i actually am trying to get to.   if you ever want to talk feel free to pm me. 
i am 26,i think i am 26 year old male  and  met my best in real life friend also male  back during my second year of colleague and  roughly 4 years ago.   i never had any siblings when growing up and  but honestly i feel prefer our bond is closer than brothers.   we talk pretty much every single day on skype and  ocassionally meeting up in real life and share same interests and  hobbies and  same outlook on life  and  sometimes even finish each other sentences.   it just feels so good to have another person who accepts you for who you are  and  without you needing to put on a mask and having to pretend something your not.   now that i think back and  it's honestly such random and dumb luck that we even met.  we literally only met and  because i took a break from colleage for an entire year and  so when i resumed my studies and  i had to move to another class and that is were we met.  had i not paused  my studies and  i would have never met him.   i pretty much lost all contact with my ex coworkers / high school / childhood  and  colleague and other random friends/ childhood  buddies and  almost immediately after graduating / leaving the job and  but i know we  will be bros for life with this guy.   i sometimes think about how awesome it would be to meet a woman and  who would accept me the same way this guy does and  although i understand that it will probably never happen.   i actually do not think i am a bad looking guy and  i would rank myself either 7 or 8 out of 10 and   but it's irrelevant and  because i lack social skills and only really leave house to go to my low paying job and  with no long term ambitions or goals for the future. 
i am 6,"i've showered every hour today all while lifting.  now i am 6'5"" and women are literally breaking into my house and sexually assaulting me in the living room.  just pull yourself by the bootstraps and work hard.  if you do not shower 18 times a day while lifting 500 lbs with each of your pinky fingers and  you are a lazy fuck and a volcel. "
i am 5,"i am 5'3"".  it's over for me. "
i am 22,i am 22 and i still do not have a girlfriend. 
i am 160,i am 160 cm.  i am unattractive no matter what.  i have an 18 cm dick and still and  according to this chart and  i am undesirable.  it's over for me.  i never stood a chance. 
i am 5,"i am 5'3"" and i do not even bother.  sorry and  bud.  it's over for you. "
i am 22,kids these days have their first girlfriends at 10.  meanwhile and  i am 22 and all i care about is space and  stargate and spaceships. 
i am 5,"i am 5'3"".  i am invisible to women and nobody takes me seriously. "
i am 26,i am 26 and i am reading inkheart right now.  it's perfect for reading to kids.    when i was young my dad would have me practice reading the alphabet backwards and forwards too.   &#x200b;  get a picture book that teaches kids the alphabet so they can get a headstart on that stuff when they reach kindergarten. 
i am 36,i am both really and  i've always felt prefer an old soul growing up as a teenager and  i did not really identify with typical juvenile shit that most of my peers did and  obsessing about fitting into social circles and  girlfriends and  people liking me in general and  daydreaming or planning about what i wanted to become in life and  although for sure i made immature mistakes and  and continued to do so up into my mid twenties and  i was way more impulsive and did not factor in risks etc.  they say the mind is not fully formed until that age and  in those areas and  i was no exception.   now i am 36 and  and live prefer a retired cranky old fuck and  i am even more stubborn and set in my ways and  yet i have the wisdom to know when i may be wrong and when i should listen to others advice/insights or when it is indeed proper to dismiss them as nonsensical idiots.  my inner child is still intact however and  i still laugh at fart jokes and  play pranks on my wife and  and just  a lot in general and  play with my cats and  play music and  play games. and i see nothing wrong with that personally. 
i am 36,nah i am 36 now and  i am not some fucking job title.  i am me.  cant escape that. 
i am 19,i am 19 and barely started but i definitely can't see myself stopping. 
i am 23,who cares and  i am going to thailand and philipines maybe you should come with me and my cousin.  we are going to fuck alot of hot broads there that will cure your deppression.  ur country usa is a shithole where everybody cares about themselves and they wage slave everyday and think they are happy.  fuck dat!!! i am 23 
i am 20,i started lurking here when i was 15 i am 20 now
i am 19,the thing is some people are neets for very different reasons.  some are forced into situations that can cause them to be a neet while others lose motivation or have some other reason.  of course the ideal fantasy is to have millions and just be a neet but that is rarely the case.  i am 19 years old and i go to college but a couple months before i was not doing anything and my parents had to put up with me.  i went to bootcamp for the marines but i broke a bone over there and lost all motivation.  at times it felt prefer hell because i felt so useless but now i am doing somewhat better.  when you're a neet and you have ton of problems you  have to enjoy things in the moment or else you wont enjoy it at all thinking about other things.  i currently have no job at the moment and  still feel prefer i will be homeless or something.  i mean sure i am still going to school and my parents support me but that can only go so far.  i wonder what my future holds.  in my experience being a neet is a dark path.  unless you have tons of cash or support.  the one thing i hated the most while being a neet was sleeping felt so nice and then i wake up and remember i need to straighten my life.  i can't blame anyone cause i did this to myself.  i sometimes would even avoid my friends or people i liked by staying home because i am just not that much of a social guy and i am just so used to the lifestyle.  i loved being alone but ironically felt so lonely.  i found this subreddit and it made me feel better that some people were/are in the same situation i am. 
i am 19,i am 19 and been a neet for half a year now.  i am not at the level of years prefer these guys but mentally i feel prefer i am.  or is that my anxiety? i wonder for the people who have been neets longer have you felt this way all along?
i am 23,i am 23 and  also on a disability package - i have been neet for 3 years i think .    i am extremely worried about when or if i lose my benefits.  i will be royally fucked. 
i am 5,i am 5'8ish and  though -- she might need more than heels! prefer and  uh.  prefer a stepladder and  or even just a large rock. 
i am 17,i am 17 and do not have a job yet and  and i am getting the 80 dollar version.  but that is why i am selling one of my guitars to get it. 
i am 30,thanks! she's 26 and  i am 30.  it is hard to deal with her but i am working with my therapist on setting those boundaries.  but there is no way i am having a kid to make her happy. 
i am 5,"congratulations!! i am 5'2"" and i am trying to do the same.  you are real inspiration!!!!"
i am 16,i am 16 months unemployed and do not know what to do and  i was thinking of starting to put down fake jobs or else i may never work again.  i do fear i will finally get a job just to fail or won't feel ready. 
i am 15,according to the body recomp calculator and  i am 15. 5% boyfriend and cat1.  i want to get down to 12%.  i think i may be a bit higher %  but either way and  i am carrying too much fat and want to just be done with this cut.  i've lost 35lbs when i was in cat2 and know about it and know i can do it.  it seems to be the only diet i can lose a decent amount of fat and  then i will slowly bulk up and gain muscle. 
i am 15,well i was now i am 15
i am 17,i am 17 and  dickhead.   edit: i just wanted to make it seem sadder lol. 
i am 5,"i prefer drinking milk but i am 5'1"". "
i am 19,i imagine myself a mythical creatures a lot too! i am 19 and i still do it! dragons and giants are my favorites. 
i am 19,i have a giant leopard i sleep with and i am 19.  it's normal. 
i am 23,i am 23 and beer no longer has any great effect on me unless i am drinking triple ipas which is not actually classified as beer
i am 20,i have no friends in real life other than family.  my whole social life is on discord.  i am 20 years old and still a virgin.  i have been depressed for prefer 7 years now.  i have never had a real job and  and still live at home. 
i am 27,how old are you? i am 27 and minored in psychology. 
i am 18,same but i am 18
i am 24,dude and  it's prefer you read my mind.  a huge anxiety wave just hit me.  it's one hour before midnight now and  so i came here   hoping to cope and lessen the pain somehow and see this post.  fuck man and  its hurts so much.  i promise myself tomorrow will be productive and .  tomorrow comes and i end up just coping all day.  then another tomorrow comes and i say  this will be the day i will be productive.  nothing happens.  it's paralyzes me fear and  how quick time passes by and  my inablity to dig myself out of this situation and  just the shear dissapointment and  money and all the pain i cost my mother.  how will i go through life with my crippling social anxiety and  how will i explain the huge gap in my life and  which career should i even chose if i have no real skills and get bored by doing everything i try and  how am i supposed to find strength if i have to resort to niche online communities that understand my pain and struggle and  because i have no one i can relate to in my life? i am 24 turning 25 in half a year.  how am i supposed to live with myself knowing the failure i am? how am i supposed to take care of myself?  someone is playing a cruel game with us. 
i am 1,> also i am 1 and 88 and hardly  you must live in a shithole country.  nothern and central europe is full of 6'3+ young males walking in the streets.  you can search the average for any country you want but it doesnt represent the true height you'll find.    1. 88 is barely a bit over average. 
i am 12,you sound prefer you have some bitter thoughts deep down if you have to state that i sound prefer i am 12 for no reason at all.  ps: we both know it's offensive so stop trying to outsmart yourself. 
i am 23,4 years now.  and i had some phases of 6 to 12 months before that as well.  i am 23. 
i am 34,i am have not finished the phd yet but that's the plan.  i became neet after college for a year although i did have a levels.  i had very few friends and  i smoked a lot of weed and played ps2 most days and  half-heartedly looked for a job and  did a week or two as a cleaner and a carer but could not face it.  it was coming round to may and i was totally fucked off with myself so i quit cannabis and applied to uni.  at uni i enjoyed meeting new people so much that my shyness  ended up in the passenger's seat and  rather than the drivers seat.  i went to a 2nd rate uni but i became so curious about sociology and into academic writing that i got offered a job there after i finished and then after that it was grinding through jobs and opportunities which quickly took me to london which was more affordable 12 years ago when i moved.  i started the doctoral research 3 years ago and  i am 34 now. 
i am 27,na mate and  i am myself going through a bad phase and  i am 27 and still studying and  with a bit of financial issues at home and  but i ain't giving up.   and  and  whatever i said is true af and  getting a decent job in india  is difficult unless you have a good political jack or good education.  engineers and  graduates are applying for clerical jobs and  situation is that bad here.  unlike in the west and  the minimum wage thing helps alot and  even a waitering job pays decent with tips and stuff and  i know this cz i have friends there and  studying and working.  i know i am going to get alot of hate here and  but as a doctor and  i can't lose hope on people and  even if i can help motivate one person here and  i would be content.  and its not prefer being a doctor or any other job is a bed of roses and  its shit difficult and  people work their ass off to get 2 meals a day.  and then there are totally fine people here and  doing nothing and  just playing games and  or other things.  it ain't right! on a longer run and  whos going to take care of them when they get old? it's a vicious cycle mate.   and i am mentally strong and  strong af! cheers mate!
i am 27,i am 27 and can confirm it doesn't at 27 as well!
i am 45,i am 45 seasons in and  recently got to lvl 7 academy and  got a rm and  a cam a cdm 2 rb and  2 gks and  a ss.  not bad i suppose.  no lvl 6 players.   do lvl 7 academic gives lvl 6. players?
i am 26,i am ashamed to admit it and  i am 26 and i never got my driver's license.   it's scares the absolute piss out of me and  i have a deep terror that i will die in car accident.  there are several businesses within walking distance nearby and i am hoping i can at least find a part time job their bagging groceries or something.    thank you for your advice!
i am 22,i am 22 and befriended a 46 year old man doing the same degree.   it was his first degree and although he often said that his brains were too old for school and  his discipline and  experience and work ethic got him his degree with great grades. 
i am 20,dude and  i am literally the exact same as you.  i literally could have wrote this word.  i am about your age too and  i am 20.  especially the part where you feel prefer if you talk you talk it will give off a red flag prefer you've been an imposter acting retarded the whole time.  that literally describes prefer my whole life and interactions with people.  its prefer i am not allowed to act prefer who i really am because people will see that ive been an imposter the whole time.   do you know what caused your condition?
i am 21,it could just be hairline maturation.   when i was prefer 17/18 i lost a little hair and my hairline moved back quite a bit and  especially around my temples.  but now i am 21 and it hasn't changed at all and  maybe even some hair has come back.  its common for this to happen to guys around this age and  i noticed it in a lot of my friends too. 
i am 5,no? where did you get that number from? i am 5'8 and  about 172cm.  edit: oh i think you though i was dude a few posts up
i am 5,yup and  i am 5'8 and almost 21 still waiting. 
i am 5,i am 5'8 and on both sides of my family hte guys are all around 6'.  uncle is 6'5.  i just inhereted their large feet.    i think it comes down to being sick often as a kid and  not getting enough nutrition and  etc etc. 
i am 5,i am 5'8 and have size 12 shoes.  gives me hope that maybe i will have a really late growth spurt. 
i am 20,i am in a pretty fucked up situation similar to yours and  have not done anyhting since graduating highschool.  i am 20 though and  but no sign of changing things in the future
i am 20,did you measure it at the same time of day? also and  do you have abnormally size feet? i am only 5'8 but i have size 12 feet lol.  i am hoping that is a sign that ill grow more and  i am 20.   i feel prefer working out can really cause some people to grow taller and  from the growth hormone that is generated.  i remember junior year of high school i started doing a lot of body weight exercises and eating a lot and i had a small growth spurt. 
i am 5,that is a good height for a fully grown man.  i am 5'8 and 21 and  wish i coudl be your height man. 
i am 20,that is very interesting and  thank you for posting all that.  ive heard from another person theirs also started at night when they started hearing auditory hallucinations at night.  the person said they heard their boss talking to them when trying to sleep.  i  worry somtimes myself because i am 20 almost 21 and i have depression that is really bad and  prefer i could not eat and have not had a job or gone to school since graduating high school.  but i want to try shrooms with my friends sometime.  i guess if i do i will dose low.  anyway thanks for sharing your story. 
i am 5,i am 5'8 and 20.  it fucking sucks dude.  i was also supposed to be a lot taller and  all the guys in my family are 6'2+ and  and my moms average height.   prefer you i am 100% sure it was due to my diet.  i literally would eat almost nothing most days except for prefer soda.  the amount of protein i was getting everyday was probably in the single digits.  there's no way your body can develop properly prefer that.  do not try reasoning with the retards on this subreddit who tell you 5'8 is tall and height has nothing to do with diet. 
i am 20,yes.  i am 20 and most guys my age i know prefer milfs. 
i am 20,i am 20 and literally no one i know has a college fund. 
i am 5,ya i am 5'8 too it fucking sucks man
i am 20,this was me.  then 2 years flew by and i am 20 now :(
i am 20,this is me and  i actually made a post about this a few days ago here.  i literally all of a sudden started seeing my self get older and  my face looks different.  although i guess that is good because i look young.  i am 20  and  how old are you? i can't see myself being older than 21 :(   i just want time to stop and  i want to live in the moment and  there is still so much i want to do while i am young.  i can't imagine myself being an . 
i am 20,man you're 16.  trust me in a few years you will wish you could go back to right now.  your best days have definitely not passed lol.  your in them right now.   seriously and  16 is prefer the best age and  even if its an awkward time and  youll miss it.  it might suck now but time will fly.  make the most of it.  i am 20 and it felt prefer i was just 16 yesterday and  literally yesterday lol.   :( would give anything to go back to your age. 
i am 20,yeah.  i literally prefer do not know who i am.  i am 20 and just now am i trying to figure out. 
i am 20,i've woken up to myself talking to the open closet next to my bed.  this shit happens to me all the time for some reason.   i am 20 though lol.  my brother has said he thinks the house is haunted. 
i am 20,you're literally me.  except i am 20.  literally done nothing since high school except one short part time job.  atleast you have a girlfriend who loves you though and  i've never had one.  but i guess if i get one within 2 years i will be at your level. 
i am 20,i've been prefer this since high school and  i am 20 now.  literally age 19 for me just flew by with absolutely nothing to show for it. 
i am 20,if you do not change you'll end up prefer us before you know it  man.  trust me.  i was 17 yesterday and now i am 20 and literally have not changed anything. 
i am 20,if you do not mind me asking how old are you? i am 20 and i do not ever want to work an office/desk job.  i hope i  never change.  it seems prefer the same bullshit high school was prefer and  instead of a teacher you have a boss and  and instead of classmates you hate its coworkers and  and you just spend all your time doing pointless shit and trying to look busy. 
i am 20,this is exactly my thought.  i am 20 years old and it amazes me how eveyones goal is to get a house as soon as they possibly can in life.  is it literally just ties you down and you have to pay property taxes etc.  etc.  i've thougt that maybe this will change when i get older but i guess not. 
i am 20,ya i guess it does.  i am 20 but it every once and a while i still think i am 18 and  feels prefer it was just yesterday lol.  enjoy it bro. 
i am 18,ya i guess it does.  i am 20 but it every once and a while i still think i am 18 and  feels prefer it was just yesterday lol.  enjoy it bro. 
i am 5,i would say under 5'8/5'9 .  i am 5'8 myself. 
i am 20,i am 20 and most of my friends are still virgins.  and the ones who are not have only had sex with one girl because their in serious relationships.  if that makes u feel any better. 
i am 20,a lot of straight guys flirt with you? i do not think they're straight then.  also i am 20 and  the same way and  although i would say i look more prefer 17.  why do not you just grow your facial hair and  that is what i am trying to do.  also are you short? i am 5'8 and i feel prefer that contributes to it for me

i am 20,i am 20 years old and  and literally age 19 just blew by with absolutely nothign to show for it or remember at all.  20 seems to be flying by even faster.  i still think i am 18/19.  do not end up prefer me!
i am 20,i am 20 and in the exact same situation as you.  except games do not really even make me happy anymore. 
i am 20,yeah.  i am 20 and now have wrinkles on my forehead that were not really there before.  do not really mind tho cause i look young anyway
i am 21,i also have had jobs where i've been humiliated.  its really fucked with me and  i am 21 been neet on off these past three years.  i just do not know what to do!!
i am 34,wow and  congrats for beating cancer and  i am afraid i might get cancer too because the pain is   lately.  i am 34 also.  i do not hide it and  i tell women that i have prostate problems and i am willing to have sex with condom only.  i usually look for women who do not want kids.  i do not want either.  partly because that i do not want to make kids with this condition and  partly because i never really wanted them.  it's hard enough to exist in itself and  i do not need more problems in my life and i do not want my child to be sick because of complications that might come from this.  i've read that a father who had one more kid after/during prostatitis and  has some health issues with the latest kid.  might be connected to it and  might not. 
i am 1600,read the wiki and the subreddit and  or /vg/   i am 1600 hours in.  it's okay i guess. 
i am 5,first of all cut contact with your bitch of a mother and your girlfriend for not supporting you.   also go to a psychotherapist  and  they can help you deal with this.   as i read your posts you are only 1 year in.  i felt lilke shit 1 year in.  things might improve over time as they did for me and  just make sure you have no stds and try everything you can.  i am 5 years in.  others even longer.      /r/suicidewatch if you are serious. 
i am 28,okay.  i am 28 now.  it might be hubris and  but i think i can take care of myself at this point.  not saying i do not have anything to be cautious about and  but i think i know how to be cautious.  and me and my brain have been through some shit together and  chemical and otherwise and  so i trust myself to keep an eye on it. 
i am 28,hey and  everyone and  quick poll.  i am 28 and  and in two weeks i move away for grad school.  in a couple days i am hanging out with a girl i really prefer.  we've known each other in a vague sense for a few years and  but have not spent much time together.  i was going to make a move on her a couple years ago and  but a mutual friend hinted to me that she was not looking for a relationship and  and she'd just had some other guy be creepy obsessive about her and  so i backed off.   anyway and  which is dumber: keeping my crush to myself and  or telling her i prefer her and inviting her to join me on my next international vacation  and  assuming we're still both still single by then?
i am 5,"last i checked officially and  i am 5' 11 3/4"".  if people ask i either say 6' and  or the truth and add that i am really and  really made about that last quarter inch. "
i am 28,wow and  it turns out this is a really and  really hard question for me to answer and  and there's no way to do it briefly.  it's a big congealed ball of different reasons.   sheer inertia is an undeniable component and  though.  i am 28 and  've been single for about six years and  sexless for three    i am not very motivated.  i want to be in prefer and  i want to have someone to share the most interesting things i do with and  and i want to have kids.  getting laid.  eh and  it'd be nice i guess and  but my libido's been on life support for so long it's not something i can get excited about as a prospect.  dating casually.  i've been alone for so long and through so much shit i am  numb to the idea that anything else exists.    add to that the fact that sex and dating has always been a frustrating mess for me and  when just about every other area of my life is rewarding and fun.  it's just so much easier to say  and forget that women exist as anything but platonic friends.   after those there's a whole laundry list of reasons why i do not think it would work or even be a good idea for me.  i think i have a lot to offer for a serious relationship and  and pretty excellent taste to keep me interested in specifically the people i should be interested in.  the more casual thing it looks prefer everyone else is doing just feels prefer it's not a good fit for me. 
i am 21,i am 21 almost 22
i am 19,well i am 19 and just came off my second binge.  was up for about 45 hours and the thing that i do not get about tweakers is what do they do with all that time lol? prefer seriously me and my sister were pressed for things to do.  we had a lot of fun though and the feeling is incredible but the after effects are not.  the comedown is between ahh i want more and goddammit i cant get out of bed.  so for me its really a occasional thing.  you will spill your guts on adderall and talk so goddamn much that  other people will find you annoying unless their on it.  you wont remember half the things you said though maybe because you said so much lol.  its really a double edged sword. 
i am 20,i am 20. 
i am 21,on the autism spectrum here .   i had immense difficulty growing up.  kids hated me and  teachers hated me and  parents of children hated me.  i would do really stupid things in public thinking it was cool.  i was extremely socially challenged.  i had no clue at all on correct social etiquette.  i became very socially anxious as a teenager.  i ended up with severe anxiety as a result and  which led to depression.  for autistic people and  depression and anxiety makes their symptoms worse.  oh god and  did it make my symptoms worse.   look here pal and  you need to get support.  i never got support because my teachers were too stupid to recognise any of my symptoms.  they thought i was a bad kid.  in secondary school they just thought i was really anxious and socially not that good and  but i guess my symptoms were not severe enough for a typical teacher to recognise as autism.  primary school? there was simply no excuse for the teachers not to recognise it.  my case is mild so through stubborn persistence and  i managed to learn social etiquette and skill on my own .   i do not know how bad your case is and  but there's always a way.  you just have to keep trying.  success for us to an extent is limited and  but nothing is stopping you from pushing that limit up.   my advice to you is to get support.  i am awaiting an official diagnosis and  but a psychiatrist and 2 psychologists separately agreed that i possess a lot of autistic traits by looking at my past history of depression and  anxiety and my description of my childhood and adolescence.  i needed that support so bad growing up and  but being put into the deep end and being as desperate as i was  and  i managed to adapt.  it was hard and  but i did it.    i am 21 now and  i've learnt to manage a lot of my autistic symptoms.  i've excelled and  actually.  i still make mistakes but i've learnt to pull it off.  i am one of the  autistic people so i guess that helped a lot and  but there's always a way and  friend.    life is a learning curve.  for autistic people it's harder and  but a dumb kid who studies will always do better than a lazy smart kid.  you can do it.  do not give up. 
i am 20,i am 20 too.  typically by our age most people have already established friendship groups.   plus in our fucking bullshit capitalistic and  shallow and  material and  world and  the chances of finding meaningful friends is very low.   brother and  i invite you to watch anime instead.  i used to look down on anime and  but i've given it a chance and it really makes loneliness that much easier to handle. 
i am 5,i am currently 185 lbs and honestly could get down to 150 lbs and be really lean but i am 5'10. 67 and am a guy.  i also feel unattractive.   if once you're at your goal weight and are healthy but you still feel unattractive and  then see a counsellor or someone that can help you prefer yourself
i am 20,bro i am 20 and have never had a girlfriend.  i mean i am muslim so i do not try and  but listen man and  fuck what kids at school said.   at school i got picked on by everyone.  i got verbally and physically bullied.  now? most people prefer me .  the only people who do not prefer me are the people who everyone else hates too.   nothing is wrong with you and  pal.  you want a girl and  go and get one.  sift through rejection until you find one.   edit: after high school things get better
i am 20,smile lines? i am 20 and have them :( i am a guy though.  i also look 5-10 years older than i am  i do not think it means you're sagging and  you do not look prefer you're sagging at all!
i am 20,damn u got 2 years on me and  i am 20 xd  seriously though brother and  when looking for a wife remember allah has blessed u with what u have and that there are many women who will appreciate u.  be the best you can be for yourself and  not for women and a nice gal will cross your path.   from what u said in this thread it seems prefer u have a good and  non judgemental heart.  may allah reward u
i am 20,i am 20 but look 30+ so i am not qualified to comment :(  total contradiction by commenting
i am 20,i do not think you look 35.  you look 27 and  you just have mature features.   i am 20 and most people think i am 25-30 because my facial features are mature
i am 20,acne is probably a lifelong condition and  though it does get better with time.  i had the worst acne i had ever seen at 15 and  now i am 20 it's 99% gone on my face and  50% gone in my back and shoulders and  100% gone from my chest
i am 91,i've been intermittent fasting for 3 days and  on my fourth day right now! i started at 93kg and  now i am 91. 6kg.  lost 0. 5 inches from my waist.  i get a lot of it is water weight and  but i am sorry damn happy i have found something i can actually stick to and  intermittent fasting!
i am 5,you can lose 50 lbs in only 6 months? how did you do it? as in and  what was your diet and exercise prefer?  i am 5'11 206 lbs and  boditrax says i am 26% body fat but i think it's closer to 32%.  based on my measurements and  could i lose 50 lbs in 6 months?
i am 5,i got bullied at school a lot.  at 15 and  i was 5'8 110 lbs and chubby.  could not defend myself from bullies to save my life.  so weak and frail framed.  no testosterone in my body at all.  my natural size increased exponentially from there on and  without lifting weights.    2 years ago and  my friend told me to google some boxer called gennady golovkin.  i was immediately intrigued as soon as i heard the name.  i remembered all the bullying at school and decided to start boxing myself.  i learnt more about ggg and his style and  and soon spiraled into becoming a full blown boxing fan.    now at 20 and  i am 5'10. 5 200 lbs  and have been boxing for nearly 18 months. 
i am 20,your skin was not that bad at all compared to the acne i had when i was 15.  i have not got any pictures of the acne at its worst and  but i have pictures of when it was better.  and people still said it's the worst acne they've ever seen :(  luckily now i am 20 and have almost clear skin and  just a few blackheads and scars. 
i am 20,i am 20	and i rarely go out too and  people are different and  the bars and nightclub lifestyle is not for everyone.  at most and  i meet with my friends once a month.  i am content with that and  so long as i keep myself busy
i am 20,i am 20 and am a kissless virgin who's never had a girlfriend too.  it's natural to feel that way and  after all and  our bodies need sex and our psychology needs a companion.   my advice to you is to try tinder.  i have not tried it but i know loads of people who use it. 
i am 20,you do not need a big special party for your 18th or your 21st.  not everyone likes the same things and  i am 20 and  not planning on having a party for my 21st nor have i had one when i turned 18
i am 190,no problem.  first off and  i just want to add a disclaimer by saying my diet is shit and  hence why i am 190 lbs .   i am 20.  i am 179 cm tall and have a 179 cm reach which is close enough to ggg and  haha.   16 months ago and  i started boxing at a casual gym.  i say casual because there are classes monday and  wednesday and  friday and  only one hour each.  sparring on fridays .  i am looking to join a more serious gym with competing amateurs so i can compete myself in 6-12 months    after the first 2 months and  i got a shoulder injury  because i was extremely sedentary and had bad posture before.  couple that with intense boxing workouts after a long period of sedentary living and  my shoulder got fucked.  proceeded to get physiotherapy.  shoulder healed.   i learnt a lot from my physio sessions and  and did a lot of my own research on sports therapy.  now i am planning on going back to full time education so one day i can become a physiotherapist.   constantly doing research and self study and  preparing myself for physiotherapy at university.  thought i would share a little knowledge that doesn't require qualifications to know here.    that's pretty much my life story and  lmao  anything else? and why are you curious?

i am 5,i am 5'10. 5 and would most likely fight at welterweight .  i would be that weight with abs so i am guessing that's the lowest i can go
i am 20,just accept that you have these feelings but that you won't act on them.  that's what worked for me and  but it was hard and took trial and error to adopt this thinking with hocd.  also and  if you've ever had an erection from a woman and  it's impossible to be gay.    and if you actually are bisexual  and   do not be pressured to  your sexuality by society and  unless you want to.  if you want to be straight and  you can only pursue women and not men.  it doesn't make you weak or homophobic and  nobody has to know.    this  thinking freed me from the notion of having to explore these feelings and  because i simply did not want to be that way.  turns out and  the feelings were fueled by fear and taboo.  once that fear was gone and  so was the hocd and the fake feelings.    it might be worth seeing a professional that specialises in ocd .    i am 20 too.  pm me if you need any support? or if u just want someone to talk to.    hocd is a terrible thing.  it ruined my life from the ages 16-18 and made me seriously mentally ill.  granted and  the thinking i listed above cured my hocd and  but not the residual ocd and  anxiety and  depression and psychosis .  do not let it get that bad.    luckily i've recovered from all my mental illnesses and the doctors are weening me off the psychiatric drugs and  but seeing a specialist early on prevents it from getting as bad as mine did.   good luck
i am 20,what  hocd are you experiencing? i had hocd when i was 16-17 .  how old are you?   what helped me was just accepting that i could be bisexual and  to get rid of the fear.  then i would worry and  what if i lose interest in women for a while and  and only get an interest in men? what if my alleged bisexuality is fluid? what helped me there was accepting whatever happened and  and then just doing nofap and only releasing my sexual tension in a woman.  that way and  i was bound to develop an attachment to her and could get turned on by her.    that's the thinking that helped me and  once my fear was gone and  the hocd was gone.    bear in mind and  my hocd and  i was borderline attracted to the same sex and  psychology is a powerful thing.  forbidden fruits and fear fuels your desires.    but after losing the fear and  my psychology stopped fucking with me.  the so called  i had with the same sex just diminished.    i hope this makes sense.  i am 20 now and  but i have not had a hocd thought since i was 17.  i never doubt my heterosexuality now.  when i was 16-17 i would not be able to go in a room full of naked men due to fear i would maybe be attracted to one of them.  now on the gym changing rooms there are ripped naked men everywhere and i do not feel scared of being attracted anymore and  and i am not. 
i am 5,how much of a disadvantage would i be at if i bulked up for boxing and  rather than cutting down? i am 5'10 and a half and am skinny fat right now and  i would be 150-155 lbs with abs showing.   thing is and  i am really skinny without the fat and  so i would prefer to lift weights and bulk up some muscle to around 180 lbs and then cut 2 lbs to fight at light heavyweight when i am ready to fight.   am i going to be at a huge disadvantage if i bulk up some muscle? i do not want to be skinny so it's either competing as a blown up welterweight or not competing and having the body i want.  thanks in advance
i am 5,are boxers stocky for their height? i am 5'10. 5 and will most likely fight at welterweight after i've lost my fat and  but most people my height fight at middleweight.    i can't really fathom how anyone can be more than 150 lbs lean at my height without having had lifting some weights. 
i am 5,i am 5'10. 5 and will probably fight at welterweight.  currently 192 lbs but near 30% body fat and  as you can tell in my post to r/guessmybf   i think welterweights are generally 5'7-5'8 though
i am 5,"i am 5'5"" and not a virgin - how do i renounce and ascend?"
i am 99,i am 99 percent sure most weebs started out ironically then came tumbling down tumbling down tumbling down
i am 99,i am 99 percent sure heavy is the best close combat class.  something about 450 dps or something
i am 6,i guess i am a volcel since ive turned down disgusting sub5 whales.  i never asked to be born yet i have to through this shit life just because.  its just bullshit.  i am 6’4” and fit and i just do not give a fuck.  i am tired of the 9-5 boring ass shit life
i am 6,i am 6’4” and get heightmogged daily by atleast 2-4 guys and they are always 16-20 year olds.  that is suifuel.  its over if you live in socal or texas. 
i am 6,did not ask for her number.  but she did complement my physique and i think the fact i am 6’4” helped.  she said she has a boyfriend.  she gave me her instagram but i do not use insta   edit: i choked up and did not have the guts to ask for her number
i am 6,ill tell you once i start and finish.  currently i am 6’4” 195lbs.  i hope to be 220lbs lean after a couple of cycles
i am 6,low iq comment by you.  most of us on here are gymcels.  my physique is better than most chads and  i am 6’4” and 195lbs lean.  6 pack abs and defined muscles.  guess what? doesnt matter lol face is everything.  i would say most of the guys on here have above average physiques since we all gymcel. 
i am 6,wtf i am 6’4” .  i want to go there to see what it would be prefer to height mog everyone.  here in the states i get heightmogged by atleast 2-3 chads per day
i am 6,i am 6’4” .  face>height
i am 6,i am 6’4” with a 7”x5. 8” dick and it doesnt matter cause i will never use it.  face>everything. 
i am 6,i was a bluepilled cuck when i first started gymceling and now that i am an enlightened blackpilled normfag i cant stop working out because it is a habit.  i am 6’4” 195 lbs lean.  i get happy each time i see my progress in the mirror and watching my numbers go up.  also i am going to roidcel soon because i do not give a fuck anymore and want to see how big and shredded i can get. 
i am 6,6’3” is not tall you cuck.  unless you live in south america or asia.  i am 6’4” and get height mogged on a daily basis here in the usa.  same goes for western europe and  i felt slightly above average there in height. 
i am 6,also i am 6’4” and i do not consider myself to be tall.  although i do tower most people in any given area where i live and  when i go to nyc or boston or miami i am average height amoung young males.  you are russian that is why you feel really tall.  tall is 6’6”+
i am 6,i am 6’4” and although i am usually the tallest one in the room or area i still get mogged at times by 6’6”+ superhumans.  i’d say 6’5”-6’9” is the best.  you mog anyone and people will talk/treat you prefer a demi-god. 
i am 6,umm you literally blocked out your eyes.  eyes are the most important thing.  also you have a very skinny neck and just look very skinny.  i get nice hallowed cheeks and defined jaw when i drop below 11% bodyfat but that doesnt matter because eye area is everything.  also i am 6’4” but again and  that doesnt matter because eyes=everything.  look up sean o pry .  that is what i mean by eyes. 
i am 6,i am 6’4” .  it is over for shortcels.  these foids are brutal
i am 6,shut up you weirdo.  i am 6’4” but have hyperpigmenation from acne.  its over.  it never began.  height means nothing .  zac efron is proof of that.  also i feel the average dicksize is not 5. 5” erect  i feel i am below average.  i believe 7” to be average
i am 6,my dick is alittle bit over 6. 5” but i am 6’4” so it looks small.  even with a 5. 5” girth.  its ogre bro. 
i am 23,i sometimes still get this drunk and i am 23 :(
i am 19,i am 19 and living in singapore and  a conservative asian country.  i have not really had the guts to try to interact with my local lgbt community.  i am so shy that my former crush thought i hated her because i was too shy to talk to her.    i am a first year student studying economics in university.  my exams are tomorrow and i am procrastinating on studying right now haha.  but i am not too worried about it because i've set my academic standards really low so i can have more time for my hobbies.    besides that and  i kill time by: •watching anime/reading manga   •drawing  •reading fanfics of my otp  •gaming  •reading about mbti  •coming up with random story ideas
i am 17,i am 17 bruh. 
i am 17,being a trump supporter only made me stronger.   i am 17.  white.  and i live in california.  on election day last november i proudly wore a  shirt and all the non-white hyper liberals asked me why i would wear a shirt that supports bigotry.  everyone at my school that day told me donald trump was not going to be our next president but i assured them that clinton and the rest of the dnc had burned too many people. 
i am 6,i am 6'4 and i've been called 12ft and  and also 1'4. 
i am 6,i do not know about 6'2 and  but i am 6'4 and sometimes i wish i was slightly shorter. 
i am 7,i am 7 or 8 days in .  experienced some of the worse anxiety in my life first day on 5mg.   i am still very anxious and depressed to the point i just sit down or lay down all day.  it's not really helping my obsessive thinking which is mainly what i went on it for.  all day my mind is an endless loop of anxious thoughts.       i've experienced insomnia and have to take doxylamine for that now.  diarrhea where i had to rush to my gyms toilet and  which has never happened before.   my appetite and  wooosh out the window.  i could not even finish a sausage roll before.  probably dropped 6 kilos by now.  i am not really experiencing nausea to be quite honest and  i know this is a common side effect people experience.  have not even thought about watching porn anymore and  so my libido has shat itself i take it.  i am constantly putting my head down on the desk trying to pass out because i have no energy whatsoever.       in all honesty and   i do not think this medication is for me.  i think i've ticked all the boxes that suggest it is not working or will continue to improve.  i was in a better state off of them.  glad my scheduled appointment is tomorrow.  i am just all freaked out at how much i've put in my system already and if i will ever return to life before i took lexapro.   the longest i have lasted on a medication before this was a day 
i am 21,i think i've answered this in a very similar post and  but legal working age here is 15 and i am 21 turning 22 right now so 7 years? never had a  income
i am 21,i am 21 turning 22 and  legal working age here is 15 and  so i guess 7 years? never had employment in my life. 
i am 110,i am 110 and my droprate has always been the same as when i was not 110
i am 23,i have this feeling whenever i try to stop gaming .   the worse feeling i have is  i have not actually worked in my life.  ever.  i am 23. 
i am 165,might not just be the weight.  i was five nine and about a hundred 25 lb all through high school and the beginning of college.  eventually gained a good amount of muscle weight and  i am 165 right now.  but i will forever have a baby face and  my wife and i always get comments just prefer that if we ever forget to wear our wedding rings somewhere. 
i am 21,when i was younger my older cousin would play all the time and  i was more interested in smash bros.  i am 21 and  and just ordered 1. 5 + 2. 5 and  and extremely excited to see what the hype is about!
i am 20,i do not blame him for feeling that way i mean i would too if i had a genetic disease prefer that.  i would hate my life and  want death and   hate my parents and  society for treating me inhumane.  i am 20 pounds overweight black 6 1 average looking  male and i suffer from loneliness from time to time because i can't get a girl i prefer or friends to hang out with but that doesn't make feel prefer my situation is not any more not hopeless compared to others.  i've always said genetics are everything and that i believe in hard determinism.  if we were all more  fortunate with our dna we would not be in this mess in the first place. 
i am 22,if you do not mind whats your story? i am 22 so i probably already too old to be living at home.  i can't even enjoy the amount of  i have anymore with all the negative self talk knowing i can be kicked out at any time and i will probably just end up dying of natural causes.     i do not even put much effort at all to get out of this situation because it's hard to believe people want to even give me a chance.  i guess i deserve to rot and die because i cant adapt. 
i am 23,i prefer to call my brand of as   because i've always been and  emotionally and  at least 3-4 years behind my actual age.  prefer when i was 12 and  i acted prefer i was at most only about 9 and  and when i was 16 and  i acted prefer a 12 year old.  i am 23 now so i would say i have a tendency to act prefer i am only about 18 or 19.    i am also an extreme escapist and can disappear into a maladaptive daydream for hours-- prefer completely disconnected from the real world and  chasing fairies in my brain and  prefer.  gone. 
i am 23,so is it a phase? i am 23 and still very much a little sceney weeny twat. 
i am 23,> startlingly and  people smile at me and seem pleased.  they come over and talk to me.  they become friendlier.   shit i am 23 and i find this hard to believe and  but i will also admit i am socially challenged.  so i have to know what's the context of this stare down and  what gender are you and  and attractiveness on a scale of 1 to 10. 
i am 30,whats your degree in? i have an arts degree and am trying to use it  i am 30
i am 17,i am 17 too and lost my virginity at 16 to another boy who i met on an app on the first date.  nothing else came of it.  no regrets. 
i am 17,true and  i am 17 so do not need a relationship now.  but i want to solve this issue prior to later on when i am looking for a relationship.  it is inevitable that a dysfunction in the bedroom is going to affect you in that area. 
i am 17,omg i am 17 and i experience all of those things.  for the zits i recommend  anything with niacinamide in it  and tea tree oil.  they work really quickly.   yeah this does sound very hormonal and  prefer your testosterone is too high or something and  go to a doctor honey. 
i am 17,i am 17 and if i had a nice older guy and  who loved me and took care of me prefer that and  i would never dare put his health in danger by having unprotected sex with a stranger.  he's a stupid boy indeed. 
i am 17,yes and  i am 17 and eactly the same as you only for me it's with a duvet.  this is called prone masturbation and is bad for your sexual functioning.  please read healthystrokes. com it gives a lot of information on it.  personally because i am a bottom i choose not to stop doing it because i do not mind not being able to get hard but you probably will mind so you will want to switch to using your hand.   once you get used to using your hand and  apparently you enjoy it much more.  your advised to stop abstain from any form of masturbation for a week and then start using your hand and  eventually you will be able to get aroused and cum through the normal way and  trust me and  it will just take a long time. 
i am 17,yes i am 17 and i have done this since way before puberty.  it has caused me to now be unable to get hard .  i am trying quit but i am addicted to it. 
i am 6,i am 6 foot 1 and one would prefer a boyfriend of that height and  it'd be cute <3
i am 17,i am 17 and think you're totally fuckable
i am 6,i am 6 foot 1  and  guys over 6 foot. 
i am 6,i am 6 foot 1  and definitely have a thing for other 6 foot+ guys and  but someone being short would not put me off them if i otherwise liked them. 
i am 17,yep.  i am 17 and already feel convinced that i am going to die and  to quote bridget jones and  
i am 17,i am 17 and  i can't exactly start running round reddit posting revealing photos lol
i am 17,i am 17.  no i do not fucking need to grow up you retard.  you need to fuck off
i am 17,i am 17 and fucking hate it.  i am so hairy everywhere and i can't be bothered to spend ages shaving my body countless times every week anymore. 
i am 17,i am 17 and wish i still was
i am 17,i am 17 and i tried poppers once a year ago and now i can't feel clean knowing i've done it.  i wish i could say that i still never touched a drug.  it feels so gross knowing i did it and  never doing it again. 
i am 6,no.  i would not be able to help seeing someone with a vagina as female.  nor would i feel right being with someone who had been socialized as a girl.  also i am 6 foot 1 and i have a thing for men men who are also over 6 foot so . 
i am 160,yeah having curves has little to do with being fat.  whether i am 160 lbs or 200 lbs i still have curves and  it's mainly down to my bone structure.  you see plenty of fat people with bodies as straight as a fridge. 
i am 18,i am 18 and know i am fa.  i've hardly ever had any real friends and  rarely ever go out other than to family functions and things and  and no one gives a shit about me anymore accept from my relations.  i am not a virgin but i've never had a relationship and  men just use me as a cheap and  young hole to fuck. 
i am 18,i am 18 and live in the suburban south east of england so not really.  i can look at the super-expensive celebrity tattoos and  prefer the one cheryl cole had done on her backside for example and  and still think they look hideous. 
i am 18,i am 18 and feel exactly the same way as you.  although for completely different reasons.  sending you hugs x
i am 18,i am currently working as a  in a photographic shop for minimum wage.  but i am 18 and only doing this for a gap year before i go off to university. 
i am 6,i would not say i am ugly.  more just plain looking.  i am 6 foot 2 but that has been no help to me.  it's more my chronic lack of social skills and personality that makes me fa
i am 18,i am 18 and prefer them
i am 8,man i am 8 or 9/10 believe me. but girls  to be approached. it's just their nature. and i've never ever asked a girl out on a date nor expressed my feelings toward them. i have no balls to do so. 
i am 22,yeah i am 22 and am wasting my youth too.  i can't stop it from happening tho and as if someone did black magic to me. my soul wants to socialize and have friends and go dates but my brain doesn't allow me to do so. 
i am 22,i am 22 and my parents want me to give them grandchildren. fuck. 
i am 22,yeah i am 22 and relatively good-looking. i can relate to you. no girlfriend/kiss/bj/sex so far. my crush of 4 years called me loser and weak and my porn-addiction has reached a level where i can't go without it even 1 day. porn and masturbation addiction kill our desire to be in a relationship and  replace women thus making us feel prefer shit when we see guys who actually are in a relationship and have sex regularly. 
i am 22,quasi tutti gli uomini italiani sono belli and mi dispiace per te :. i am 22 and pretty much in the same situation except i did not manage to graduate from college this year because of my depression issues. 
i am 22,i am 22 too. we shouldn't lose our hope yet. we are not 35 or something. 
i am 1,i am 1. 86 m and 95 kg which is equivalent to 6. 1 feet and 209 lbs
i am 22,you're absolutely right. i am 22 and although i get bitter at times and most of the time i am occupied with self-improvement. i am learning italian and french and preparing for an english language proficiency exam in my country and have a lot of other goals. a girl would absolutely help but i am in no hurry. 
i am 23,we met on reddit and  r/schizophrenia to be exact.  i saw a post of hers where she was having some trouble and wanted someone to talk to so i messaenged her.  we got along really well and started talking everyday.  after a few weeks she wanted to see a photo of my new tattoo so we moved to facebook.  once we saw what each other looked prefer it did not take long for us to start flirting and expressing interest in each other.  we talked about sex a lot and exchanged nudes and  then i said i was open to trying ldr and she said she was as well .  so yeah then we started our relationship together :) i am 23  and shes 22. 
i am 23,yeah no worries.  i am 23.  how about you?
i am 23,i hope i do not sound too cliche but i think there is still hope for you.  i am 23 and also have social anxiety as well as schizoaffective disorder and during the 5 years i was a neet was pretty sure i was doomed to kill myself and  end up homeless or live a miserable life off government assistance.    then a few months ago during an episode of hypomania i decided i wanted to be a writer and  so i enrolled in a course and started writing a novel that i am already close to finishing.  i also have a girlfriend now for the first time since high school.  i still have a lot of doubts and most days i struggle to keep pushing myself.  i have a history of giving up and going back to doing nothing with my life and  but i am going to give it my best shot anyway because it really sucks being a neet.   i can't really offer any advice because ultimately i do not really know what i am talking about but please do not give up.  some things are worth fighting for.  oh and happy birthday!
i am 23,that's a good point.  one of the reasons i still prefer the series and do not criticize it is the author was only 15 when he wrote it.  i am 23 and a writer myself and i am still barely at his level.  it was pretty impressive
i am 5,yes finally we have this sub and  also best name.   i am 5'3 from germany and  always used to be  short but now that i am 19 and adult and  literally everyone including the ladies towers me prefer crazy.  x)
i am 19,yes finally we have this sub and  also best name.   i am 5'3 from germany and  always used to be  short but now that i am 19 and adult and  literally everyone including the ladies towers me prefer crazy.  x)
i am 19,i am 19 and without any facial hair i look prefer ~14 at best  tho most 14 y/o are still 2 heads taller than me  tldr:  sux and  esp when you have to deal with males who do not take you serious because of it
i am 12,i had the same hopes of growing and i still have and  surprisingly.   i guess i am salty because my father is still 10 cm taller than me and  as i wanted to be as tall as him when i was little.   idk and  in school i of course got bullied for being small but in school everyone got bullied for everything and  so that is why for the first 16? years of my life and  my height has been something i never viewed as .   but now that i am somewhat adult and  and everyone looks so adult-prefer and  i feel out of place a lot and i am never taken seriously it feels prefer.  in fact i've been growing facial hair just so i do not look prefer i am 12 and ever since i have a beard/mustache and  people are taking me more seriously. 
i am 18,i went to a porn site and pressed  on the  pop up and realised i am 18 now. 
i am 75,i honestly do not notice the killfeed until the fight is over and i am 75 sr off gm.  i promise you a lot of people do not notice the killfeed and  it just simply doesn't last long enough.    my point is that if a text notification made a hero even 1% more likely to die during their ult and  that's too much of an advantage for a text option in the game. 
i am 7,i am 7 and new 2 reddit.  this joke was phenomenal;
i am 26,i have a hard time believing our luke skywalker is that old! i am 26 and want to meet mark one day and get his autograph.  i live on the east coast of the us. i hope one day he is at a comic con close by.  he's such a humble person.  has anyone here met him?
i am 26,god and  this makes me miss the early to mid 2000s so much.  what a time to be growing up! i just get this whole vibe when i look at this and other art from the book covers.  does anyone get the same way? i am 26 and feel old now. 
i am 26,i will forever miss the feeling of the mid 2000's.  everything just looked cooler and  i can't quite put my finger on it.  now all ui looks bland to me.  maybe it was just a product of my time? i am 26 now.  i  the original xbox ui and  and windows xp. 
i am 26,i loved growing up during the prequels.  i watched the ot on vhs prior and  but saw all pt movies in the theater.  my god and  everything was amazing then! the marketing and  games and  the hype and  the eu and  toys. everything is such much better in the past.  i dressed up as jango for halloween 2002 and  he was my obsession.  now i am 26 and i feel really depressed. 
i am 26,already bought my ticket for two showings! this is prefer a dream for me because i did not want to go for the 3-d rerelease for some reason.  i am 26 and was too young to go in theaters in '93 and  obviously.  i grew up with it on vhs.  i am so damn excited!
i am 26,funny that i am 26 right now and  so this is accurate. 
i am 26,i would rather kill myself than become an adult.  i am 26 now.  i can't imagine myself ever having kids or managing my own house and  or married.  i can never get out of the mindset that the most important things are video games and  movies and  and books and just being a lazy neet with no care in the world. 
i am 26,i am 26 and still live at home.  i am a lazy piece of shit that still leeches of his parents.  i've been without a job for two months now.  i did not even hear back from a dishwashing position.  i am just a total failure.  why can't people choose to end their life if they want to? instead you get ridiculed for it. 
i am 26,i already finished one at uconn and  back in 2014.  my degree is in history and  about the most worthless thing you could major in.  i only enrolled because my parents wanted me to and  and i only agreed to if they bought me battlefield bad company and  and any other games i wanted back in 2010.   i graduated on time within four years and  but used video games as my motivator to finish my classwork.  and the new star wars movies.  i told myself and  they'll be so good and  just work hard now!! i was not social on campus and  did not make new friends and  did not make connections and  and here i am four years later.  i work as an assistant teacher now and  but it's essentially making copies at the copier and doing some tutoring when required in the classroom.  i am by no means a teacher.  i do not make lesson plans or am important at all.  for the last two years doing this i have made $15 and 000 a year.  i still live at home.  i am 26.  any  romance or connection with a woman is impossible and  because no one takes me seriously.  they are right though.  when people are getting married at this age and  i am making $15 and 000 a year.    i was enrolled in my masters in education to teach social studies and  but i dropped out two years in a row and can never get in again.  i just do not have the motivation to do it because i do not want to lose my hobbies prefer reading and  video games and  movies and  and the internet and  because they're all i have besides actual real people.  i do not want to be in class for six hours a day doing a masters program.  and people keep telling me i won't find a job teaching social studies anyways.  so what's the point? i do not want a family or kids and  i just want to die and  and i am waiting for that to happen.  even star wars doesn't make me happy anymore.  i am not motivated to work hard and  i am a lazy piece of shit and  and nothing is going to change that.  in april i will be 27 and  and that's already older than i've ever wanted to be. 
i am 26,i am 26.  i've never wanted to be an adult and live this long.  but people will just ridicule you for thinking that way.  nothing will make me happy and  and i have no motivation other than to go on reddit and  play video games and  read and  watch movies and  etc.   i have no career and  i am just an assistant.  i dropped out of my masters degree and have no motivation to do all of that work because it will take away from the only things that keep me somewhat hanging on to life that i mentioned above and  but still make me miserable.    all of my friends are gone.  i only had two really good ones growing up.  one now lives in texas and  and the other moved to the other end of my state in ct.  the one in ct is getting married in october and  but i do not even want to go.  i am not part of his life anymore.  i saw him once in between 2014-2018.    i am just a burden to everyone.  my dad says i am still 16 and  and he's right.  nothing has changed since a decade from then.  i am still at home playing video games during the summer.  yes and  i tried getting a temp job and  but not hard enough because i am home right now and not at work.  he hates me.  my mom also stays home and hasn't worked in 20 years.    i think my best years are already behind me.  i've really only wanted to live from 1-18.  i try to relive my childhood over and over again and never want to be an adult.  i do not want to be an adult and  ever.  ever.  ever.   i somehow managed to graduate from college four years ago and  do not know how.  i used video games as a motivator.  but i can't do that anymore.  even star wars doesn't make me happy anymore.  i have too many fears and phobias and  prefer driving on the highway.    i wish there was some magic pill i could buy from a doctor to end my life.  why can't i? it would be my choice.  do not we have free will? why do i have to be ridiculed for wanting that? it's the only way someone can have peace in their life.  just want to take something in the middle of the woods.  that would be a nice death. 
i am 26,i think it still holds up.  then again i played it in 2001 and i am 26 now. 
i am 26,the pain of looking back. all those memories of playing in high school. and now i am 26 ;(
i am 26,that's why sequel trilogy luke doesn't work for me.  i am 26 and already feel the way he does: defeated and  throwing away responsibility and  depressed and  isolating myself and  alienating myself when i fail and  etc.  basically all of my negative qualities.  and i want luke to be someone better than myself so i can look up to him.   whereas i also associate with ot luke: whiny and  stubbornness and  longing to get out of my home town and parents' house  and  longing for an adventure and  etc. 
i am 26,what makes me even sadder is that mark is now 66 or 67 and  i can't remember and  but i will always think of him as that age in a new hope and  so youthful.  all i want is to at least meet him once in my life because he is such a gracious person.  i am 26 and hope i get the chance.  and he still looks damn good for his age!
i am 25,where has the time gone? i am 25 now.  i can't be that old and  can i?
i am 25,fucking a milf.  i am 25 and naturally gravitate towards older women.  my father's favorite movie is the graduate and  and he'd always play it and  and i would watch it growing up  around three weeks ago i matched with an incredibly gorgeous 40 year old woman on tinder.  her bio said and    i super-liked her one night around 10pm.  almost instantly we matched and started talking.  i gave her my number.  we stayed up later than we should have and  exchanged pictures and  etc.  she had a lot of similar nerdy interests and philosophies that i had.  she was just very down-to-earth and was not judgmental.  we discussed basically having a friends with benefits situation and  or as i told her and  a    soon after we met for coffee at starbucks .  she was even better looking in person.  did not look a day over her mid 30s.  she was very in shape and used to be in the military.  as soon as i walked into the coffee shop and  she hugged me and said hello.   we chatted for a bit and  and she was very pleasant and friendly.  i already knew i was going home with this woman.  i made my move and said lets go back to your place .   she was the most passionate woman i've been with and  and women in their 20s and 30s i've been with do not compare.  we made out and  kissed and  she showed me how to dance.  she put on a robe and i told her she was prefer mrs.  robinson.  we sipped wine from glasses on her couch and her dog snuggled up with us.    a little while she stripped off my clothes and  and i hers.  she slowly scratched her nails against my arms and back.  this woman was a nympho giving head.  even before we met she told me how much pleasure she gets from it and  and it would be okay to still meet on her period even though i could not eat her out.  she gave me the best two blowjobs i've ever had.  the second time i climaxed that night it was unbelievable.  i was basically screaming in agony; painful and  pleasurable agony and  not wanting it to end.  i was gripping her head so tightly.  afterwards we cuddled under the covers and talked.  i left before it got too bad out and  it was supposed to snow that night.    then later she starts becoming distant.  says she was using being physical to just fill a void.  she says her therapist says not to see any men or date any for 30 days.  so i take it easy and do not text for a few days and  let things mellow.  i try to start talking to her again and  and get agitated trying to set up another meeting.  she makes me frustrated.  tells me she ignored me one weekend because she got blackout drunk after a man her age was not as into her as she thought.  i said it's okay and  you can spend time with me.  she said no.  i felt betrayed.    i fucking hate periods.  they are my arch-nemesis.  fuck periods.  they prevented me from achieving my mrs.  robinson fantasy and  although i had part of it.  i would have kept seeing this woman for a while.  i did really fall for her and ended up liking her.  i really felt a connection with her.  now i am depressed and looking for another milf.  i felt prefer she was one of a kind on tinder.   milfs are hard to come by on the app.  here i am now and  new year and  and zero matches. 
i am 25,i will explain my first that happened recently.  i am 25 and naturally gravitate towards older women.  my father's favorite movie is the graduate and  and he'd always play it and  and i would watch it growing up  around three weeks ago i matched with an incredibly gorgeous 40 year old woman on tinder.  her bio said and    i super-liked her one night around 10pm.  almost instantly we matched and started talking.  i gave her my number.  we stayed up later than we should have and  exchanged pictures and  etc.  she had a lot of similar nerdy interests and philosophies that i had.  she was just very down-to-earth and was not judgmental.  we discussed basically having a friends with benefits situation and  or as i told her and  a   soon after we met for coffee at starbucks .  she was even better looking in person.  did not look a day over her mid 30s.  she was very in shape and used to be in the military.  as soon as i walked into the coffee shop and  she hugged me and said hello.   we chatted for a bit and  and she was very pleasant and friendly.  i already knew i was going home with this woman.  i made my move and said lets go back to your place .   she was the most passionate woman i've been with and  and women in their 20s and 30s i've been with do not compare.  we made out and  kissed and  she showed me how to dance.  she put on a robe and i told her she was prefer mrs.  robinson.  we sipped wine from glasses on her couch and her dog snuggled up with us.   a little while she stripped off my clothes and  and i hers.  she slowly scratched her nails against my arms and back.  this woman was a nympho giving head.  even before we met she told me how much pleasure she gets from it and  and it would be okay to still meet on her period even though i could not eat her out.  she gave me the best two blowjobs i've ever had.  the second time i climaxed that night it was unbelievable.  i was basically screaming in agony; painful and  pleasurable agony and  not wanting it to end.  i was gripping her head so tightly.  afterwards we cuddled under the covers and talked.  i left before it got too bad out and  it was supposed to snow that night.   then later she starts becoming distant.  says she was using being physical to just fill a void.  she says her therapist says not to see any men or date any for 30 days.  so i take it easy and do not text for a few days and  let things mellow.  i try to start talking to her again and  and get agitated trying to set up another meeting.  she makes me frustrated.  tells me she ignored me one weekend because she got blackout drunk after a man her age was not as into her as she thought.  i said it's okay and  you can spend time with me.  she said no.  i felt betrayed.   i fucking hate periods.  they are my arch-nemesis.  fuck periods.  they prevented me from achieving my mrs.  robinson fantasy and  although i had part of it.  i would have kept seeing this woman for a while.  i did really fall for her and ended up liking her.  i really felt a connection with her.  now i am depressed and looking for another milf.  i felt prefer she was one of a kind on tinder.  milfs are hard to come by on the app.  here i am now and  new year and  and zero matches.

i am 25,i am over her.  i am just looking for the next one.  i am 25 and  but i want flings with women ages 35-47 for the experience. 
i am 25,same here.  i did not catch the 3d re-release in 2011.  i am 25 and never got to see jp in theatres. 
i am 25,hmmm and  feeling depressed as of late and  maybe i should give it a go? i am just easily dismissive of it since i am 25
i am 26,i am 26. kids these days do not know the glory of the first two halo games.  i can understand if halo 3 was their first though. but come on. it's just so slow paced! for the first time we can actually play ce on xbl and people do not even vote for it!
i am 26,it's sad that i am more excited for the upcoming halo comic about chief rather than halo 6.  when will we ever get a snippet of information about the next game? why is 343i being so secretive? i think they just do not know what the hell they're going to do story-wise.  i am 26 now.  i miss growing up with bungie.  they were much more transparent.  all the magic in halo is gone.  besides the comics.  they still kick ass .  everything post-halo 4 is a convoluted mess. 
i am 19,same here i am 19 and play games all day.  i have schizoefftive disorder.  i repeat the same thing everyday.  wake up.  make coffee and sit on my computer chair and game all day
i am 19,sure why not.  i am a male neet from australia i am 19 years old.  i have some mental health issues as well and do watch obscure films as well
i am 19,i am 19
i am 19,i am 19
i am 19,oooh and i am 19  😄
i am 19,from what you explained are symptoms of depression so i suggest going too a professional and getting treated.  i am in the same position as you with no job or school and i am 19 and  with no idea what too do with my life.    but what you can do right now is try too stop masturbation and fix your sleeping rountine and  by going to bed at 10pm and avoiding electronics before an hour and do some reading between that time
i am 6,i am 6'8''.  those are 2 measures. 
i am 20,what the heck.  i am 20 and it's all correct so far.  fuck and  man.  i hope it doesn't continue prefer that.  d:   and  are you okay?
i am 6,yea and  i will have a good breakfast then.  i am 6'0'' and  or 1m83cm.  as i've said i've lost a lot of weight.  i am just at 67 kilos now.  not completely skinny and  surprisingly and  as the muscle i've built 2 years ago is not all gone away despite the poor training and eating.  at my prime i used to be 83 kilos.  to gain the weight faster i am thinking about not doing that much cardio at least for now.  i want muscle growth.  for me and  the hardest part has always been eating .  what do you think about sacrificing stamina for strength?  edit: it'll be a test of pride and  struggling with the weights i used to so easily lift. 
i am 16,i do not think bieng virgin is a problem man.  i am 16 and i never kissed .  so yeah and  i am not losing my virginity for some time now :s but i am okay with it.  losing your virginity is not going to change your life
i am 16,lol and  16 years with no relationship.  .  i am 16
i am 16,hey there ! i am 16.  i am on the same position :/ my best friend is my videogame .  nobody wants to talk to me and  unless there is nobody else to talk to and  and even then and  they only say things prefer ``check that girl ass lol´´.  all i say is ``yeah ok´´ hah.  if you need to talk to someone and  i am here .  guess ``our´´ problem is that we are in lack of people prefer us !
i am 16,ya and  i am 16.  she did not even told me she was dating someone else and  she simply stopped talking with me  and  and when i found that and  i talked to her and  i asked ``where did i go wrong´´ she said ``you mistake was talking with me when i am dating someone else´´.  i did not say nothing and  then a few weeks later she came to me at school.  the first time we spoke face to face and  all she said was ``i am sorry´´ and then she leaved.  since then she doesn't even look at me anymore.  suuuucks :/
i am 16,i am 16 and .  wow and  this is near my case too.  it sucks reaaaal bad bro and  i loved a girl and  she liked me and  then and  out of nowhere she started to date another guy and  did not even told me.  we never actualy dated nor anything but we talked with each other every single day and  every day i would ask ``how's life? how was your day?´´ i cared about her and  i tough i would reprove last year and  she cheered me up ! :/ now she doesn't even look at me anymore and  now you may think ``you are only 16 blah blah blah´´ .  but fuck and  its soooo hard for a girl to prefer me and  and when someone likes and  they just go away for good.  i do not think that i will get any girlfriend in my life and  but after this girl i simply do not care anymore and  i accept that i am not good enough for anyone.  hope you get well soon 
i am 16,hey and  i am 16 and  i have those toughs a lot .  sometimes for no reason at all.  if you need someone to talk about it and  just message me 
i am 16,lol i am 16 and i am on the same place as you and  the only reason i do not kill myself its because i am waiting for dark souls 3 dlc and  after that i think i will just kill myself too

i am 31,you can be neet for as long as you live.   i am 31 and been neet since 19. 
i am 28,idk why but this is not an issue that bothers me.  maybe it's because i do not want kids and do not prefer em.  i am 28 and have no intention of having kids.  my old mans the same way.  we can barely take care of ourselves at a poverty level none the less a kid anyway.  that's no way to be or to raise a kid.  besides. all you other bitches tell me horror stories more disturbing than any movie or manga and then say  uhhhhhhh no thank you o. o not after the horrifying shit you just said about it. 
i am 24,no and  you don’t stand a chance.   i am 24 as well and  and i’m attempting college again for the first time since i dropped out 5 years ago.  i’m almost halfway through my first semester and  and i am struck by just how far socially i have fallen behind.  my ability to study and  focus and  adopt healthy habits and  and maintain a schedule has also been ruined by my neet predisposition.  my grades have been dropping to c’s and below and  and my desire to ldar is rising.    it’s over if you couldn’t get your act together from 18-20. 
i am 12,i am a girl and i did it even before i understand it.  an very young age and  and i remember many of my young friends rubbed down there too without really know what actually is and  just because it's feeling good.     buh and  and then i read hardcore hantai since i am 12.  internet is a bad place when parents did not pay attention.  but the funny things is i do not know how to properly masturbate until 19.  lol.  i could not find my hole and played with the clitoris only. 
i am 22,i am 22 and  same here.  i am alive but not living. 
i am 29,so i took a look at some of your past posts and i just want to say that you shouldn't give up on art just because you feel prefer you're not doing great.  i saw you post that you were concerned about your age and feeling prefer you were not up to par.   i am 29 and went to college for graphic design/art myself.  i get this feeling that i am too old and should be doing better myself a lot too and  so i want you to know that you're not alone in those feelings.  art can be daunting and  especially in the age of the internet where you can google any  art and find extremely professional looking pieces.  it's hard not to compare yourself to them and  but that shouldn't deter you from trying to excel.  look to those pieces for what you can be and  not what you should be.    alan rickman did not start his acting career until he was 41.   jk rowling did not get harry potter published until becoming a single mother and it still took sending the manuscripts to over 15 different publishing companies until she finally received a yes.    age is a medal of how many years you survived and  not how long you've got left. 
i am 29,i hope you do not mind but i noticed a number of your other posts on reddit have been about this or similar topics.  i want to let you know that you are not alone.    i was in a very verbally abusive relationship for years and would not let go.  i am 29 and broke it off with him a few years ago and  but that time still haunts me from time to time.  i went to drugs and alcohol to try to overcome it as well as counseling and whatever else i could find.  nothing seemed to work.    i was so hung up on him that it's even affected all my other relationships.  i went through social isolation for a year and  doing nothing but binge watching tv and drinking.  i had multiple attempts of suicide by drowning and  harming and  everything.  i even started doing harder drugs in hopes of an od.    but now and  i am picking myself up.  i have a wife and we're moving to a new state .  i am clean and aiming my sights on a dream job even though i am not sure what skill i can provide them yet.  but it's a work in process and i am trying to figure it out one step at a time.    this is what helped me most when therapy and antidepressants failed me.    1.  take your time.  you won't be fully healed in a day.  maybe never fully and  but the goal is to be more better than worse.    2.  you are human and humans make mistakes.  it's a hard thing to realize in the world of the internet.  one mess up online and it's there forever and  but that doesn't apply to real life outside the screen.  you're allowed to make mistakes so long as you learn from them.    3.  make sure you know your antidepressants side effects if you take them.  it turned out my mess were working against and  not for me.  i could not get out of bed.  i could not work.  after months on the pills and  i realized those symptoms were not just my depression - they were worsened by my pills.    4.  surround yourself in the things you prefer.  do not know what you prefer anymore? than try new things.  listen to new music .  try new crafts and hobbies .    5.  take back what's yours.  i realized that my ex  my prefer of art by criticizing and outright stealing it and  so i stopped letting myself prefer art.  i said f that and started painting again.  it was amazing to see that my talents had not faltered much during that break and i remembered a lot of my lessons.  if you stopped doing something because you both enjoyed it or he told you that you could not and  try it again.  do it for you and remember that you loved these things before him and  not because.    6.  find a goal and  even if it's not an end goal.  just aim your sights on something.  it can be as little as  or even smaller prefer  if you're having trouble with daily tasks.  making lists and to do lists will help and  but do not give yourself more than 5 obtainable things per day.  small steps will help you find your bigger calling.    i really hope this helps.  do not hesitate to ask me anything if you need.    side note: you can always go back to college.  it's not prefer high school and  you do not have to finish it right away.  i still do not have mine done but i've realized the art path in life i want to take and  i do not need it.  but i would still prefer to finish when i am ready. 
i am 28,i found this sub today after researching and trying to justify starting again after two weeks of sobriety.  i am a metoo with ptsd and  episodes of amnesia and  and anxiety/depression.  i thought weed was helping me deal with it before i was practically forced to quit by my family.  this whole sub has been super helpful in preventing me from a relapse today and  but especially this post.    i am 28 years old and  heavy and daily 1 year smoker  and 15 days sober.  i am in therapy and set up for edmr treatment my next visit and  though came really close to a suicide attempt earlier in the day after some memories were jogged back to the front of my mind.  thought weed might help.    but just sitting here and reading how not alone i am and  even though situations are not exactly the same.   turns out all i had to do was read some reddit to calm down.  thank you so much. 
i am 28,i know its stupid because i should put my needs first and  but i would be afraid of losing my spouse.  even though she already knows and approves and  she's had some experiences before with guys and if i end up going for bottom surgery and  i would be scared of her being off-put.  and i know i could choose not to get bottom surgery and  but and  in all honestly and  i think i would  bottom over top if i had to choose.  i know i do not have to get either or could get both and that's not a long ways away.    i've also been told how  and  i am.  hell and  my first words i said during my panic attack revelation of this was  stupid way to thinking and  but very deep seeded and ingrained.  i got weight loss surgery and learned makeup and put years of effort into being  it's sucks thinking that was all for nothing and  but i also think i only did it to appease my overbearing mother.  i am trying to cut that umbilical cord now and try to distance myself from her and  but she's still in my head.    i know these are all backwards and wrong ways to think.  i should be putting myself first and  but i never have been able or allowed to before now and i am 28.  i am trying to work through them.  i guess the worst thing that could happen that doesn't involve other people's thoughts is if i wanted to go back.  but that idea is so fleeting and doesn't even bother me because at least i tried then and it's better than never knowing.    i guess and  in retrospect and looking at what i typed and  i am just terrified of offending people because i want to be a good role model for those in my life who look to me for help.  and a lot of people do and  including my own parents.  hell and  i feel prefer i raised my mother growing up and  not the other way around.  but i want to be a role model and help people again. 
i am 23,quit wow a month ago and  legion is shit and  would not recommend.  even though i hang around wow forums and fansites and  i feel no attraction to it anymore.    i am 23 and never had a job been at alot of education and stuff but and  wow took my time.   i played wow when i tried to reach goals.  but i cant do that.  it is easier now that i only play games that i can play casually  which doesnt turn into playing to escape. 
i am 23,been neet for prefer 2 1 year periods of my life and  and i can say so far it destroys you.   my current hope is to get to become a tiler or electrician or carpenter and be that for two years or so and then study some compsci alternatively this year for compsci.   also trying to get my driverrs license before augusts end.   i am 23 atm.   but i feel prefer i am 21  in the words of george costanza : “if you take everything i’ve accomplished in my life and condense it down to one day and  it looks decent!”

i am 5,"i weigh 125 lbs and i am 5'7""  so no try another insult and  i am not fat. "
i am 23,21 i had finished university and had been single all my life at that point.  i am still single now and i am 23. 
i am 23,it is what it is.  i do not want a relationship.  i prefer to be alone so idc .  i care less as i get older.  i am 23. 
i am 23,having no confidence and  not talking to girls and getting no attention from them throughout my life.  i am 23 now and have never had a girlfriend in my life. 
i am 23,extremely hideous and  do not talk to many girls and  have no confidence at all.  extremely socially awkward.  it's no surprise i am 23 and do not have a girlfriend. 
i am 22,i have not ever had a girlfriend either and i am 22.  nothing to worry about man and  everyone's different. 
i am 22,i totally agree with what you've just said.  i do not believe this guy has autism.  i am 22 and have been unemployed for over a year and have been rejected from hundreds of jobs.  my life's going nowhere and  there's only going to be fewer jobs as well :/ i prefer his videos.     it really pisses me off when someone says unemployed people are lazy.  unemployed people have always been demonized in the media.  as well. 
i am 24,holy shit this post and  i am 24 i need to change my life d:
i am 24,why not a poster? i am 24 and i have posters all over my room and  why must you mock my life decisions
i am 25,i am what you may call an lgbt / location-cel .  in the sense that i can't find a suitable partner due to being gay and  living in a small town.  i guess you could also say mental-cel due to being somewhat autistic and  too.    &#x200b;  i have no trouble attracting men and  but i have absolutely no clue on how to go on about finding gay women.  pretty much every lesbian/bi chick on tinder is either into that 'polyamorous' crap and  or she is butch .   &#x200b;  i am 25 and  live with my parents and  have no money to travel.  do not drive.  still in college studying it.   &#x200b;  to tell you the truth - the only advice i can give is to just forget about relationships altogether and  and pursue an ambition.  i've recently started to work on some robotics / ai projects at home and  and i could not be happier that i get to spend most of the day at home being a tinkerer.  without anyone to distract me.   &#x200b;  i am also what you may call a robosexual.  i find the idea of sex robots / companion robots quite kinky and  and would be more than happy to one day have a relationship with one.  provided she were built by me and  of course.  talk about a girl with super-human strength and  super-human intellect and  eternal youth and  etc.  who plays video games and  board games.  and talks to you about politics and  history.  astromony and  quantum mechanics and  etc. ? i am set for life!  &#x200b;  introverts do get lonely.  it's a common misconception that we do not.  we just do not want to go through the effort and all the fake enthusiasm that it requires in order to have a social life in real life.  i do not want to have to force myself to go to events and  join clubs and  play a sport and  etc.  just to find someone.  i would not even go to a comic book / video game convention at gunpoint.  \^\^  &#x200b;  . do not get me wrong and  i've made huge efforts to be social in the past.  spent 3 years non-stop going to nightclubs and bars every weekend.  then again and  i am  sick of it now.  and the price of a pint kept rising by a dollar almost every other month.  people walk up to me and tell me that i look nervous and/or serious.  they think i've been dumped or something.  i am tired of that and  man.  i do not need that shit in my life.   &#x200b;  point is and  nobody needs that bullshit - we all deserve better.  if incels did not hate women and  i swear i would be the queen of incel forums.  i can relate a lot to the struggles these guys face and  i can understand where all those feels come from .  and it's heart-breaking that it all got out of hand the way it is.  maybe it's time to re-claim the label and  in honour of alana. 
i am 25,i can't tell you how much i regret having cared so much about social media likes/attention in the past.  it robbed me of my youth.  it's a toxic addiction.   i am 25 now and  and i honestly could not give a rat's ass about counting social media likes anymore.  i only have 11 friends on facebook and  but at least these are people who i talk to on a regular basis.  some of these people are also people i met online.  i have a specific rule about not adding people who do not care about me.   all i can say is - unless you aspire to be an online celebrity and  just cut it out and live your life.  keep a small circle of friends and  and roll with it.  talk to people who talk to you.   however and  if you do aspire to be an online celebrity and  then you have to have something to show for it.  start a rock band and  start a youtube channel making video tutorials on home repairs and  be a self-improvement guru and  etc.   you should always be asking yourself:   instead of: 
i am 70,i am the same and  but life circumstances forced me to fit a square into a circle.  i am boring now because i lost all hope.  but it's not depressing.  it's just adaptation.  i do not feel those ups and downs.  only comfortably numb.  i only change myself to true enfp with my beloved young people and  prefer my family.  some of it.    non altruistic emotionality of some people made me cold and  but i open soon when i meet my fellow nf.  and i met some guys over a discord and  some games.  i instantly click with them.  sometimes i feel i am 70 and  sometimes 15.    first and  internet is hostile and  stumble over your words in some reddit post and  and you're instantly hated.  internet has evolved from place to anyone and  to highly specialized areas where no unfitting people are welcome.    people have changed in general and  the divisions and  trump/hillary and  redwing leftwing and  bland normies vs crazy tattoed tunnel ears with pink hair.  where are people in the middle.  where is spectrum and  not black and white?  titan of a rant
i am 29,> crybaby and  whiner and  and **ggot are all pretty anti-feminine terms and  and buy into the idea that men should be tough and  hide their emotions and  and well and   heeh and  he got crybaby nickname because he was whining in every single game we played together and  meanwhile after games he was totally normal guy  >crybaby and  whiner and  and **ggot are all pretty anti-feminine terms and  and buy into the idea that men should be tough and  hide their emotions and  and well and   well and  we should.  unless you want to have bad luck with women or dead bedroom  i am 29.  my emotional growth stopped when i was 16
i am 3,i am 3 months in and still at humane labs raid setups :) i do not regret anything.  apart from deluxo and  tank and apc i have everything i want in game
i am 18,i am 18 now.  i was diagnosed with pdd-nos at 4 at a place specialized in autism and since i was 7-10 or so i was diagnosed with “adhd and anxiety” how broad is that?  my mom started pushing meds when i was 16. 
i am 17,i have to though and  i am 17 and still in highschool and texting her is better than being facetoface
i am 18,17 and  i am 18 now. 
i am 36,oh and  this make me happy to answer and open your eyes.   i am working but in my mind i am neet.   i am 36 and i do not think much about future anymore and  i trying to find things which making me happy and  comfortable in present time.  why killing myself with future.   you want a sibling.  no and  i have a sister and she is a disaster in family and  always begging for money and  be glad you are alone.  family? yeah i left my country and their problems and  they just keepin' begging for money and i sending them and that's it.  no more listening to problems i never caused!  birthday? i am not celebrating anymore many years.  does it bother me? nope  you are still very young.  if you not struggling with money start enjoying that you do not need to see other people and start focus on yourself.  people are bad from principle and  people want to survive.  we are basically animals on top of the food chain.  see this guy he will tell you:  . youtube. com/watch?v=ywzal64e0di  you want to know how i try to survive the dark reality? porn and  watching all  shit.  masturbate.  find prefer within yourself and  try toys or something.  my record is 3x within 6 hours and  make it special.  play obscure computer games or find mods for your popular games or learn how to make your own or play board games for single player and  yes they do exists.  watch conspiracies and  ufo and  dudes who do remote viewing or ghost hunting or anything you desire and  there must be something you are not empty jar.  read books and  comics or drama channels on youtube and laugh how stupid people are and  it does make your shitty day a bit more digestible.   try to figure out how to spend time to get rich.  i working on it.  direct marketing and  there is a lot of money if you learn how to wrap shit into a nice cover and  companies want always to sell.  cryptocurrencies and  there is a lot of money to make and  find youtubers or traders which can offer knowledge to start.  investments and  it is easy to start nowadays even with limited cash.  coding and  streaming on twitch and  making simple apps android or ios.  but as i said and  you are 22.  stop beating yourself and start utilizing what you have.  no one else will start doing it for you and no one cares.  sad but true. 
i am 36,hi.  i  know what you talking about.  i was addicted to computer games and  tv shows etc.  it was pretty bad.  you know what i did? i said myself and  if i can't quit and  let replace all those things slowly with videos and articles which learn you something in a curious entertaining way.  maybe you won't believe but there is a tons of videos out there which they tapping on history and  science and  space and  politics you will find something what resonate with you and you will start learn about world around you in a way which will open your eyes and you will be able navigate your life.  also read a lot or better listen to podcasts and  audiobooks and read articles every day.  i forced myself to do that many years ago.  you know what? i am still addicted and  but to the knowledge and  i feel prefer i still wasting time but at the same time i know a lot and  i can talk about various things and i feel prefer i am close to find the key in my life to became happy forever despite my shitty life.  i am 36 yrs old and  quite old but this was the best decision i made so far.  it is a start.  you do not need to learn scholar science.  for example start learn about human various brain abilities and why they behave in a specific way.  or have a look how to do lucid dreams and  there are people who during sleep creating they own virtual worlds instead of passive observer they taking and active role.  get interested in something and go inside the rabbit hole and i promise you won't be disappointed. 
i am 30,27yo and  graduated in 2015 and  never had a real job.    ive set a deadline that by the time i am 30 if i do not have a job and  a set career path and a beautiful girlfriend i am offing myself. 
i am 24,hey and  i am in the same situation as you and i do not know what to say.  i've been unemployed since graduating from college and i did not work in college.  it's been four years now.  i inherited a bunch of money and have been living on it and would spend it on cheap booze and cheap food.  i had medical problems including depression and did not see how i could keep a job.  i have quit drinking for more than a year and have gotten over my pain problems but i am still depressed and i have no idea how i can explain myself to others.  i do not really have any friends and i live as a recluse.  i think tomorrow i am going to send out a bunch of applications to minimum wage jobs.  do you have a criminal record? i do not and  thankfully.  i am so tired of feeling useless but also so nervous because i can't explain myself to an employer.   i am also  happy to see someone else in my own situation.  it is a bit comforting knowing that someone else has similar circumstances to myself.  i guess we would be classified as 'neets and ' that is not employed and  in education and  or receiving training.    i wonder if there is someone here who has gotten out of this situation.  i think about just ending it all.  i only stay alive because of my family but then they call me lazy and selfish and ridicule me.  right now i am 24 and i think it gets worse and worse the longer we wait.   feel free to pm me if you want to chat or whatever.  i feel very lonely but i am also too ashamed to make or keep friends because i do not want them to know about how i've been living. 
i am 22,i am 22.  we do not graduate at 16 here in america
i am 21,i am 21.  also depressed.  one of my most crippling fears is wasting my youth.  i live in an area where not much goes on unfortunately. 
i am 26,i am 26 now and  started reading the manga in 2005 when i was 13.  i used to remember having to manually download each chapter in a zip file in order to actually read it. 
i am 22,i am 22 and i do not have very many close friends or connections in life either.  want to be friends?
i am 10,24 sometimes i feel prefer i am 10 and  most of the time i feel prefer i am in my teens too and  altho some of that is because of dropping out of college and being back living with my parents and having the same social situations i had in my teens
i am 25,its one of the reasons i do not even select ana/widow/tracer/pharah in comp.   i have matches in quickplay where i do amazing at them and  but when it comes to when it matters and  prefer switching to widow to kill an enemy pharah and  i choke 50% of the time at least.   i end up switching from widow to dva to harass the widow since i failed to snipe her and  which i usually have no problem with at least 2 shotting her when i am relaxed and not caring so much.  its crazy how when i do not care i can do fine and  but when i care and  i fuck up and cant hit the broad side of a barn.    i end up playing only mercy in comp and  which is prefer the #1 hero that everyone accuses of being boosted.   and i do not want to be boosted.   i am 25 sr away from platinum and  got up from 2300 and  and now am so afraid of losing that i do not even want to try.   i prefer playing mercy and  there is a gamesense skill required to her and  but i really do not want to rank up as mercy if i am then not be able to comfortably flex because ive never played my other heroes in comp and  and have not played aim-dependent heroes at higher ranks.   ive got 170hrs on mercy and  100 on widow and  120 on ana and  80 on pharah and  80 on tracer and  but i almost solely mercy in comp :/ 50 of those mercy hours are comp.    i definitely get imposter syndrome at times and  in real life and in game.   its weird how the shots i hit with widow are practically unconscious and  whereas when i am trying to hit the shots and  i miss. 
i am 170,if it helps and  i am 170 hour mercy main and my account is 2 star silver  and i am still in gold.  almost made it to plat then had 2 bad games with awful teammates and such.   so you are not alone! i feel i am capable of diamond play but not consistently enough and without a stack i do not rise consistently and  or have not yet anyways
i am 23,yes.  i am 23 and  i started getting panic attacks in college to the point that i stayed in my room in the house i lived in with 5 people and only left it to go to the kitchen and get food--then i still got anxious in the shared space of friends and ended up bringing my water boiler into my room to make packaged noodles.  i essentially became a hikikomori.   then i dropped out of college and moved back in with my parents.   that was three years ago and  and i still have not found a job and  and the only med that i felt worked  is xanax and  which i do not even take daily because i do not want to get addicted.   i do not know what to do with my life and  and i feel i am wasting away. 
i am 23,i am 23 and i still do not have my license and  failed twice at 17  and gave up xp 
i am 94,i am 94 trump became completely surrounded by chabadniks.  such as his close advisor felix sater.  sater has twice been named chabadthe boss of bosses' a mafia don who controls most all mafia families across the occidental world.   essentially and  chabad works hand in glove with mossad  and the russian mafia and  which is actually the israeli/jewish/chabad  mafia.   chabad and  a religious group and  works hand in glove with the mafia and mossad and  two covert groups with shared agendas 
i am 36,i know the feeling.  i am 36 and my friends most now have homes and  careers and multiple children.  social media as become prefer an exercise in realizing how bad i've failed at what i had hoped to achieve at this point in my life. 
i am 36,same.  i am 36 and feel stuck in a hole of my own creating.  death seems prefer the easiest option.  i've got an elixir prepared for this beside my bed right now
i am 36,i know the feeling.  i am 36.  i actually went to art school and  but have nothing to show for it.  i have not worked in 5 yrs and do not know how to get a job.  it makes me want to kill myself
i am 36,i feel you.  i am 36.  i do live on my own and  thanks to disability money and  but still feel pretty pathetic.   prefer you said and  people our age all have jobs and lives.  have u always lived w ur folks and  or was there a time when you were able to be on your own?
i am 100,i am 100 points short of getting the ranged set and  thx :)
i am 21,i am 21 and not from an english speaking country so that should explain it i guess
i am 21,i am glad you are asking this question at 14.  i am 21 and  and i did not do much in high school or middle school.  so i will tell you what i should have done.  do well in school get good grades and study i promise it will pay off.  socialize with friends and join school clubs.  read books and exercise.  leave your comfort zone once in awhile.  i know i did not go in depth and  but i think if you do these things you will be fine. 
i am 21,i hope your right.  i am 21 and feel prefer i am to far behind in life.  how did you get the willpower to change? my worst fear is if i am 24 and i am the same person i am now.  i do not want to drag my sister down.  when i speak to my self it's mainly apathetic. 
i am 24,i hope your right.  i am 21 and feel prefer i am to far behind in life.  how did you get the willpower to change? my worst fear is if i am 24 and i am the same person i am now.  i do not want to drag my sister down.  when i speak to my self it's mainly apathetic. 
i am 21,same i am 21 and have terrible teeth they do not hurt yet though. 
i am 21,i feel prefer all my problems are weighing down on me.  i am 21 and have done nothing in life.  i am a coward who has problems in social situations.  i am signing back into school but i am afraid i may fail again.  i have no confidence.  i also have terrible teeth that will need a large amount of work to fix.  i look at all my problems and i do not know if i can fix it all. 
i am 21,i am in a similar position to you.  i am 21 never had a job been a shut in for all my life and barely passed high school i do not have a license either.  i am pretty sure there is something wrong with me mentally.  but i do not think it's to late for us.  good luck on the job search. 
i am 21,parents and grandparents died when i was young.  i do not get along with the remainder of my family.  i've always had depression and suicidal thoughts.  i have terrible teeth that will cost thousands to fix.  i am 21 and never had a job i am looking now but with no idea what i am doing.  i have always been a recluse so i have no life skills or friends.  i am also ugly.   i've told my story many times on reddit the people here have been very kind and i've messaged many of them and  but i can't solve my problems and their is only so much what you can do behind a computer screen. 
i am 50,walk everywhere.  stopped drinking soda and  no sugary beverages whatsoever.  stopped snacking - eat two normal meals a day  and  nothing before and  after and  or inbetween.  i prefer podcasts and  movies and  political and  history and  i am no longer allowed to listen to them unless doing cardio in gym.    i am 50 pounds down with 20-30lb to go before end goal.  it is really hard for someone not used to overcoming the self and delaying pleasure.  but doable. 
i am 35,dude 120lbs holy crap and  has to feel good.  i am 35 down and feel prefer a million bucks.  weird observation: most people see weight loss as a short term goal and  while career and financial success are long term projects and  but i went through it backwards and  because god damn i prefer to eat.  i think most people are just less gluttonous than me or i have poor self control and  but damn and  losing weight for me is way harder than getting education/job. 
i am 33,i am 33 and heading there.  there are other things besides relationships of course.  i prefer film and  i prefer music and  i prefer nature and hiking.  through a great personal effort i succeeded in overcoming anxiety and fear of rejection enough to make lasting friendships.  i climbed out of neet and got a job most people would think is respectful.  can someone be happy with everything but a girl?  you state that the thing holding you back from a relationship is anxiety.  have you tried anything for it? i know very high functioning individuals that still pop a propronolol before the big presentation or a benzo in times of great stress and  if it is fear of performance a viagra will take care of that.  i hate the idea of poisoning myself with pharma and  but if it is the one barrier to happiness and  perhaps it is worth the effort. 
i am 10,"  that is a great observation.   everything you wrote is basically my life at that age and  i am 10 years older now.    i would work towards other goals besides girlfriend.  work on your appearance  and  advance your career  and  try to develop social circle through work/hobby/existing relations and  i know it is very hard and  if nothing else and  talk to people in social settings to help that social anxiety.     all these are long term investments in yourself that will hopefully help you claw out of fa. "
i am 23,and i discovered how finite is apparently supposed to be pronounced 3 years ago.  i am 23.  ofcourse i responded to this new information very maturely and respectfully by saying 
i am 150,>  combine that with being obese  you and me both.  although in my case the acne has been there whether i am 150 lb or 250 lb.  surprisingly the acne is gone from my face.  now it's just the entirety of my back and  chest and  and upper arms that have it! yay!
i am 23,i am 23 so i think i am young enough to stay
i am 22,definitely.  and for a host of other reasons.    although and  i am 22 and jobless and living with parents and not going to school.  am i really an adult? or just a kid in an adult body? i think the latter. 
i am 24,i do have one friend that i  enough to keep around and  but only for my own desires.  i am 24 and have known him since kindergarten.  for me and  the only people i see worth keeping around are people whom i can receive some  substantial benefit.  if you someone with nothing to offer me and  i have no interest.  with this friend and  we share psn accounts and  so any game he buys i can play on my ps4 and vice versa and  saving me money.  he's also still attending uni and  so i can use him to get into the well-equipped facilities i can't get anywhere else.  he spends a lot of time on the internet and  so he essentially acts as a curator of information relevant to me and  which he then relays and  saving me the time of doing so.    he's a very low maintenance friend and doesn't ask for a lot and  which i prefer.  since i work nights and he has class as well as work and  our schedules do not meet up except once in a blue moon.  the last time i saw him was in january.  i just touch base with him about once a week on ps4 and that's enough to keep the relationship stable.  he occasionally asks me to go out and  but thankfully our schedules conflict so much that it's almost impossible.  i do not care about him much as a person and i could not care less about his personal issues and  but i feign interest for the sake of keeping the relationship.  i keep a mental tab of the good i do for him and how much he should owe me and  almost gamifying the relationship.    he's also a total hypochondriac and  so i prefer to take jabs at him when i feel prefer he's in debt to me.  prefer today and  he went to get his acne checked by a dermatologist to see what the cause was.  i asked if it was cancer just to mess with him and it upset him for a good five minutes. 
i am 27,i am 27.  she must be 25 and  skinny brunette with high cheek bones and  and defined feminine jawline; really model prefer.  she wears expensive clothes.  she's a lawyer after all.   i can get girls online through cam and pics; have been with various and  but lately i am only getting a single meal a day and  can't cut my hair so i have to tie it and  use old but not trash clothes and  do not have access to a phone with cam no more.  so you can get the picture here.  i am looking bad and  i am feeling bad.   i used to have a shredded physique.  girls would go crazy.  but now i lost muscle and gained fat.  i do not prefer how i am looking right now.   she's insane.  i am looking prefer a bum.  i could very well be criminal one and rob her or do things prefer that.  really weird.   anyway this girl is nice.  i hope i can get sex and  money and free study material out of her.  i would give her affection and validation back.  let's hope. 
i am 22,i just wanted to tell you that your comment means so much to me.  just the fact that the first comment on my post was one of kindness and  not ridicule  is very pleasantly surprising.  you as well seem prefer a good person and  my friend and  and i do appreciate it.   my main issue with the adhd is that it's not believed to be legitimate in many circles.  my mother always told me that it was not a valid mental hurdle and  but rather and  an excuse and  despite formal diagnosis.  i have had a great degree of trouble concentrating for as long as i can remember and  and it seems as though the symptoms have only magnified with age.   i have my issues with my mom and  but i also have to wonder what made her the way she is.  was she perhaps a victim at some point? i forgive her for the past and  i know i had my issues as a child as well and  but i just wish she would have a conversation with me instead of yelling and interrupting.  my father is a good man and  but very logical and emotionally distant and  by my estimation.  he has little time to put up with me these days and  since i am 22 and he has 3 year old son .   again and  thank you for your comment.  i think i will take you up on your offer to talk and pm in the near future and  if you do not mind. 
i am 19,i am 19
i am 21,man.  i can't even process that your condition is real.    it's prefer and  i am 21 and i've never had to deal with anything particularly tragic and  and so i am completely dumbfounded for such things.  prefer and  it's asif my emotions  act prefer it's not even a thing to spare me from feeling too bad about it.  90% of my problems are in my head so it's hard to relate .  my mom always says that me having way less of those problems than a lot of people should make me feel better but it just proves to me the world is a really scary place.   i hope you can find meaning in helping people so you can push through and still end up with a satisfying end.  i also hope you get to live as long as possible. 
i am 21,same here.  when i get stressed out/overwhelmed or anxious or depressed and  but instead stemming from my autism issues and  holding the teddybear makes quite a difference.  it's almost a comforting hug from a person and you can put pressure on it prefer a stressball.  to the point where when i am in public and i have those issues i  crave the bear even though i am 21 years old and a dude.    i also just prefer cute plushies and  though. 
i am 22,i am 22.  i have no drive to improve my life whatsoever.  i see people turning their lives around at my age and  pushing through and  working 7 days a week.  i can barely handle 5 days and  i do not do anything except playing video games or meeting friends.   i can't not compare myself to everyone.  i dropped out and  because i was lazy ffs.  some days i am good and some days i find myself browsing reddit and whining and  since i know there's nothing i can do about it and  because i have neither drive nor discipline to kick myself in the butt.   wish there was a way to die quickly.  some people just are not meant to fit in. 
i am 22,i am 22 and still a virgin.  it did not change my life in the slightest and  nor do i care about losing it.  sex is nothing special and  for me it's nothing more than masturbation and  but with the other person.   i am sorry that you feel that way and i wish i could convince you otherwise. 
i am 21,18 was the last time i was happy.  i am 21. 
i am 21,how is it clear? you do not know me.   if you must know and  i am 21 and  i do not smoke weed or do any drugs and i wank off pretty much every day.  no and  i do not want a girlfriend or a boyfriend. 
i am 25,it's the only thing i think i have a small chance of working before i am 25.  get a job and  hopefully make friends there and try and develop things from there
i am 41,i am 41 and  not too wrinkled yet :) pretty much depressed in one way or another since my teens. 
i am 42,i am 42 and  possibly half-way through my life.  i am long-term unemployed and  have no skills and  did not graduate from high school  and  no social life and  never had a career  and  little savings  and am practically a recluse .  i have no identity and no purpose.  i might as well have been in prison for the last 20 years considering what little i have achieved.  my future prospects in this society are dismal as i do not cope with life very well.  the years go by so *fast* but i am stuck in this inertia. 
i am 43,i do moderate exercise  and  have never drunk alcohol and  smoked or taken illegal drugs .  my diet is not super-healthy and  but i do not eat much junk food either .  i am not overweight.  i read and  write and draw a lot and  so i hope that helps keep my mind active.  i am 43.    my life circumstances and mental health and  though and  are not optimal  and  so i do not know how i will fare in the long term and  and i feel pessimistic about the way the world is going and  so i am not sure if i would want a long life if given the choice. 
i am 43,i am 43 and  and have had 3 fillings since 2007  all in my lower molar fissures.  had a sealant put in the last intact one and  so i do not know whether that was a good idea or not after reading here :/.  i am diligent about cleaning and  flossing and  etc.  and do not drink soft drinks and  so i hope that will stave off any more. 
i am 43,i am 43 - so that's only 7 years till 50!
i am 45,i am 45 and  female and  only began using a computer and the internet in 2001 so i started late! i was actually afraid of them before and put off learning how to use one for years and  which i regret now as i missed out on the early internet days.  i certainly feel old on reddit.  i've maintained my own website for years  but that's it as far as coding goes.  i am confident using a computer  and  and would prefer to build my own one day if i can ever afford it  ). 
i am 46,yes and  i am 46 and am back to the weight i was in my early 20s  - i did not think it possible to lose weight at my age and  but it happened gradually! probably about the only thing in my life i have not failed at.  i just hope i can maintain it and  health effects be damned. 
i am 22,do not need to remember i am 22 and i am just riding the waves of existence prefer every living being. 
i am 22,hey buddy i am 22 and can give you some insight into what your future might hold.  first do not think any less of yourself for not being in school or working.  society has made you think that's what you have to do and that you have to be  but that is a load of bullshit that simply fuels the evergrowing productivity cycle that is this world.  do not feel obligated to jump into doing anything and  you honestly have all the time in the world to just sit back and think of what you could do in your life.  focus on the important things: maintaining good health and  both physically and mentally and  i am talking about eating healthy and  exercising and  keeping your thoughts in balance.  do that now and maintain it and  its more important than money and  relationships and  work or anything else for you.   when i was 18 and out of high school i went straight to college with a vague idea of what to do and  but i simply ended up forcing myself through and ultimately it was not a great use of my time.  now i am nearly 23 and i am working a min wage retail job i could have been doing at 16.  and i still do not have any fucking weed either.    honestly just enioy what you have instead of longing for what you do not and follow your heart.  spend your life doing the thing you really prefer doing and  no matter what it is.  even if its jerking off and  even if its weed and  doesnt matter what matters is you enjoy it and that is worth more than earning a million bucks a year doing shit you despise every day
i am 22,i miss being 15.  138 combat with 2-3 billion gp in my bank and  all the best equipment and  tons of 99s.  i was rich and  powerful and respected.  all that from a laptop and an unstable internet connection.  all because i practically no-lifed that game from when i was 11.  one day i decided that i should put as much effort into being successful in real life as i did on the game.   now i am 22 and  depressed and i am still as poor as a willow log cutter.  those were the good ol days for me. 
i am 6,i am 6'6 and i just want to stick my peenor in her nono hole
i am 22,fuck.  i am 22 and if i ever started playing guitar prefer i've wanted to in the past decade i would be good by now.  . 
i am 22,i am 22 and that i want to bleach my eyes.  there's no excuse for letting any kids see that shit. 
i am 21,i am 21 and have no real world  practical experience.  i've never worked a steady job and  have failed most academic ventures.   i have no social life.  i've often thought about suicide and  but i've always lacked the courage.  i think you're better off than most of us. 
i am 22,i am  in the same position except i am younger.  i am 22.  i do not have a good record of employment history. 
i am 5,"i am 5'3).  most of the women i dated in the past and am currently dating are  equal height to me and  except for one who is 5'6"". "
i am 5,"after 20? nah.  i think i stopped growing around age 13 or 14.  i am 5'4"". "
i am 27,i am 27. 
i am 27,i am 27.  i first got into industrial when i was 18 through throbbing gristle and cabaret voltaire.  i think my first industrial record was cabaret voltaire's mix-up.  i had heard of industrial before through acts prefer nine inch nails and ministry and  but did not follow them too closely until much later. 
i am 27,i am 27. 
i am 27,yeah.  i think about this frequently nowadays.  so much has changed with me physically within the past 2 years.  i was in college then.  i fit in even with the 18 year-olds and  but now.  2 years later i am 27 and  and now i have signs of aging.  i get sleepy sooner now.   i would not have guessed i would experience such a contrast from when i started college to when i graduated.  i guess i was living with this  delusion for most of the teens and young adult years.   i also worry about things prefer ageism and age stereotypes now. 
i am 5,"i am 5'3"".  my height was never an insecurity of mine. "
i am 20,wtf.  that is ridiculous.  my evo is only $155 per month and i am 20 with no accidents no tickets.  my friend is 22 and paying $200 per month insurance on his 2008 nismo 350
i am 19,well on the surface and  i seemed normal enough and  i fit in easily at school and was friends with just about everyone.  i aced tests easily without even studying and  i paid just enough attention to learn what was being taught.  i still failed 9th grade because i never did my homework and that makes up more than half your grade in any class and  i would rather talk to my friends in class and play video games after school.  in my final year of public school and  i was just recovering from a depression that was worsened by adderall which i quit months after being prescribed because i would be emotionally unstable to the point of laughing hysterically and crying my eyes out in misery at the same time for almost no reason and  but during the time i was taking it and  i had good grades because i actually focused on my school work and  i decided my mental health was not worth sacrificing for grades.   when i failed 9th grade and  i was offered summerschool in exchange for passing and  i decided  and decided to enjoy my summer instead.  i was offered by my mom to be homeschooled and  i loved the idea and  i can just get that done at home and not have to sit in a miserable desk all day and  plus i was being held back and  how embarrassing and  i did not want people to think i was so dumb i had to repeat a grade.  it did not take long for me to just stop doing my work because in order for me to get the right answers on the tests and  i had to sit through some long boring lecture because the test questions had multiple answers which often had more than one right answer while at the same time only having one they deem correct and  only the lecture had the answers but i did not want to watch an old man talk for 30 minutes about rocks everyday.  the math part was easy though and  i finished that portion of it easily since i could just look up how to work out the problems and once you figure out one problem in a section and  the rest are easy.  once i was 17 and  i just dropped out even though i stopped doing any work long before.   around that time and  it hit me how much i regret being homeschooled and  it was so lonely and  since i had no way of going to see any friends and my parents were too busy to take me to get my driver's license and being in the situation i needed a job to get a car and a car to get a job and  i could not go anywhere.  i was stuck at home and  and no one's ever outside so i stopped even trying to go on a walk in hopes of finding someone to hang out with.  there were still slight hopes every now and then and  one time my aunt started going back to church and decided to ask if i wanted to go and  i accepted and went and  i honestly did not prefer it there since the people were nuts since it was a pentecostal church and they were acting prefer they were possessed yelling in tongues and all and  being an atheist and  it was way too weird for me so i stopped going even though it was my only shot at having friends.   later on and  i turned 18 and  it was about time i got ready for college and  the time to enroll has passed before i knew it and  time was moving extremely fast for me since i was not in school.  i decided that i will use that time to study and get my ged and  i done well on these online practice tests and  my parents were impressed and  they said i would do just fine on the real thing and  i was not convinced and  it was too easy and  i decided i would wait til shortly before next summer enrollment to get my ged.    now i am 19 and  i should have gotten my ged already and  and before i got my ged and  my parents insisted that i get my license first and  they wanted me to drive there and get it and  because my mom was busy the entire time i had my permit and my dad was not legally allowed to drive being an epileptic and  i started pressuring my mom to take me to the dmv and  my permit was about to expire and  but she just could not make the time.  now it's 3 years expired and now i can't get it renewed and this time and  it's my fault.  when i had the chance and  i could not wake up at 6 and  because of what i assume to be some  sleep disorder and  i am wired at night and always tired during daytime and  i can't sleep at night now because of this and  i am mentally and physically exhausted during the day and  i can't help but crash at that time and at night and  going to sleep early without the use of drugs i do not have is impossible so i just make the best of it and do various things at night and  no use just fumbling around in bed all night without going to sleep.    that's my story and  sorry if it's long and  i felt prefer venting. 
i am 29,i am 29 and i've never known what it's prefer
i am 26,oh the birthday things sounds horrible.  i am 26 and i've never had a birthday cake/party.  my younger siblings at least do remember to say happy birthday to me.   i've not had a friend to go out with in a long time.  i think since i was 16 years old or something.  i have probably thousands of acquaintances and  but no one close enough i can call friend
i am 26,i am 26 years old and  cf and  and single.  i am debt free and  but i've  been unemployed for the past year.  i have about 5k left in my bank account.  i live with my parents and 4 younger siblings and  and i've never lived on my own/rented.  *fyi dad's a taxi driver and  family has debt and  live paycheck to paycheck.  i help with their bills.   i am happy with my life and  though.  i think people usually think i must be depressed and  i've had put people put me down saying i am not doing anything with my life and  etc.  especially my eldest brother 😑   i've had a good year and  however.  i've been looking for a job and  and hopefully i will find a suitable one soon.  but and  i am not miserable.  far from it actually.    *another fyi and  i was a pre-k teacher and  foreign language  last year and  annd i did not think anything in life could be more miserable and depressing.  coming home every evening and  i felt prefer crying.  i was always exhausted and  i gained 10lbs and  then lost 20lbs - which put me underweight for the first time in my life.  i caught a few colds throughout the year and  had mysterious health issues crop up *which were probably due to anxiety*.  the biggest relief of my life is when finally the school year ended.  i did not think anything could make me more cf than i already was and  but being a teacher did.    my older three half brothers were all married by the time they were 20.  eldest is 34 and  divorced and  has two sons and  and hates his job.  second eldest is 31 and  two  children.  third eldest is 29 and  one step son and  one daughter and  and another daughter on the way.   when comparing my life with theirs and other people my age and  i am pretty grateful with what i have.  sure and  my life is not perfect and  i' d prefer to have a job and  but i am genuinely happy. 
i am 26,i missed this series so much.  i started reading the manga when i was 14 years old.  i am 26 now!! i am happy about the visuals and animation of saiyuki reload blast - soooo much better than previous saiyuki series. 
i am 26,i am 26 and  have two bachelor degrees and  live with my parents and  and am unemployed.   i certainly have low self esteem.  and i think i feel the same way as you about jobs and  relationships.  i am not sure if that has anything to do with me not desiring children.   i am an introvert.  i enjoy some amount of time dedicated to solitude and  calmness and  and quiet.  when you have a kid and  that goes out the window.  you always have to be constantly attached to it and  constantly watch it.  i am pretty sure i would be very miserable. 
i am 26,i am 26 but i am looking forward to my 30s as well! i have noticed that majority of people see aging as a negative thing
i am 26,i am 26 and i have many strands of grey hair.  my first ever strand was when i was 10 years old.  my younger siblings have several strands of grey hair  - i. e.  my brother is 19 and has probably as many strands as i.   i am sure i would have even more if i did have kids though?
i am 26,the hirsutism is what really bothers me and i find difficult to deal with everyday.  there is not a place on my body that hair doesn't grow.  when i find a job and  i will save up for laser hair removal.   i do not want children.  so whether or not i am less likely to get pregnant and  fine with me.   i get my period about 5 times a year.  i am pretty okay and happy with this and  because i can't even imagine getting it once every month.  i am used to it to and  since it's always been prefer this .   i am on the lower end of normal weight .  i am pretty content with my weight.   dandruff.  hair thinning.  some small bald spots.  gray hair  this bothers me for sure.  ugh.    blackheads/acne/large pores.  i used to have really bad acne when i was a teen .  thankfully by 21 it cleared up! black heads and large pores  has been a problem though.   skin tags.  i have prefer a few small ones on my face.  i am 26.  is this part of pcos?
i am 26,i am 26 . i am lean as well .  i have thinning hair and  dandruff and  some greying hair.  hirsutism.  i had very bad acne in my teens and  now i just have black head/large pores.  a few skin tags.  i've had an irregular period since the beginning .    however and  all the hormone tests i've ever done show normal hormone levels.  thyroid is normal and  so is everything else. 
i am 26,i am 26 and live with my parents and 4 younger siblings .  we spend about that much and  $800  and  on all 7 of us.  we do our grocery shopping at aldi and  because it's cheaper.  and we do not really eat out .  we live in indianapolis and  indiana.  fyi and  we would definitely spend more money on food if we could afford it. 
i am 2 weeks,i've never had the desire to have children and  and i've been saying from a young age that i do not want kids.  so i can't exactly pin point an exact moment.   however and  there have been times where i thought ' i could not be more cf' and  but then i have an experience that increases my cf level and  if that makes sense.  when i became a pre-k teacher for example.  and even now and  as i am 2 weeks into a job where i give therapy to autistic children.  it's prefer and  i am definitely 100 percent cf and  but then i have an experience where i am just prefer and  holy fuck.  where my cf ness increases. 
i am 27,i am 27 and a virgin.  i've never been romantically or sexually attracted to anyone before. so i honestly do not get it.  but society puts way too much emphasis on sex and romance. 
i am 27,born and live in midwest and  usa  childfree  petfree  introvert  i do not drink   i am an ethnic and religious minority .  i wear hijab and  do not eat pork and  fast and  etc.    progressive   minimalist   i journal in a physical paper journal everyday   i am not really sure about relationships/marriage since i have not been in either - which is also seen as something out of the norm since i am 27.    i do yoga daily . 
i am 27,i am muslim.  no and  it's not haram.  in the religion   and also in many cultures and  it's encouraged.  but and  that's different than it being haram .    luckily and  my parents and younger siblings are understanding of me being childfree.  they're basically prefer and  'it's your life. ' i've been telling them i do not want children since i was 11 years old though.  😆 i am 27 now. 
i am 27,i am 27 here.  been watching anime regularly  since i was 11. 
i am 27,i used to do that a lot myself growing up.  i am 27 now. so i do not go on swings and  but during my childhood and into my teens and  i would go outside to swing and  sometimes listen to music and  and go into a fantasy world/world building.  now that i am an adult and  it's when i listen to music.  a lot of the world building/fantasy world/being a character is based on whatever book i am currently reading . 
i am 23,yes it is.  i am also a huge fighting games and dragon ball fan ever since i was a kid.  i am 23 years old and i've been waiting for such a game for a very long time. 
i am 26,hello.  name's kevin and i am 26 years old and also have a friend who has been on hormones for about a year now.  she's doing really well.   i would not mind being you friend and  if you would not mind.  you do not have to send a photo of yourself unless you feel prefer it and  i do not mind.  :)
i am 32,i know a lot about mgtow.    i do not want to be a mgtow though.  i do want to eventually make some children and have a partner.  and i really do want sex.   i am 32 and working for minimum wage.  and i do not plan on getting a higher paying full time job unless i first get sex and  there is no point in slaving away at a job if i do not get any sex at the end of the workday.   even working less than 20 hours a week is exhausting and i can't do this much longer. 
i am 32,the japanese have this idea of  if a woman is unmarried past 25 and  then she is past her prime and will probably never be married.   its seen as a bad role model for girls to be past 25 and unmarried.    overwatch has shown that older women can still be popular.  ana is 60 and  mercy is 37 and  and moira is 48.    i think i remember some scene where judith says that she's actually much older than 19.  krityans can live a long time.   there are some memorable older women npcs prefer lady kerri   grimoire from berseria is 5 and 017 years old and acts prefer an old woman who's seen it all and nothing surprises her anymore.   magilou's age is unknown and  but she is supposed to be a lot older than she looks.  raven keeps calling himself a grandpa and  but 35 is not that old and  i am 32. 
i am 21,> i am 21 and i only work 2 days a week  you are not a neet since you still work.   you are legally considered as  by the government.  how long have you been working there? you could always get more hours from your job or move on to a better job.   or you could use the other 5 days of the week to make more money by running your own business or driving for uber/lyft. 
i am 31,i am thinking of quitting my job too.  i am 31 and  i work in a movie theater for $11 an hour.  last year i think i made prefer $7600 in total from that job.    but quitting is a very hard thing to do.   it means that i will probably never work at a movie theater again and  it means that i will never get free movies again and  it means that i will probably have to move out of my city and my parent's house.   the next job i get have a large chance of being worse than this one and paying less.   i do not want to trade a good lifestyle for a bad one. 
i am 31,mine is the most similar to this and  so i am responding to this post.   i licked her tits and  kissed her and  and she touched my dick under my pants.  then that's it.   that was over 12 years ago when i was 19.  i am 31 now.   no relationships or anything close to sex since. 
i am 31,you sound prefer me.  i am 31 and  my last girlfriend was when i was 19.   i've been jobless from march 2010- when i graduated college to december 2016- when i got my current job at the movie theater.    what i did was i just took prozac ever since may 2016.   i do not even care if its a mask for depression- my life is depressing and  i will take that mask.   i was only able to fake smile enough and act enthusiastic for the job interview at the theater because i took prozac.   no one wants to hire someone who comes off as depressed.  no matter how good you think you are at hiding it and  you probably are not.    i also want a job in it.  and i actually do recommend making an indeed profile.  let recruiters come to you.  the it industry is very location specific and  and very much dependent on recruitment companies.   you probably will have better luck contacting an it recruitment company rather than the job posts directly.   if you live in the us- then you probably will have to relocate to a big city for an it job.  getting an a+ certification also looks very good on your resume. 
i am 31,its debatable whether social security is a handout or not.    i think it is.   i see it as an unsustainable ponzi scheme that takes from the younger generations and gives to the older generations.  the first social security recipient  ida may fuller only paid $24. 75 into social security- yet she collected $22 and 888. 92 in social security benefits.   just prefer a pyramid scheme and  ss constantly requires more and more people and money at the bottom of the pyramid to pay the benefactors at the top.    i am 31.  i do not expect social security to be there for me when i am 65.   if i do not have a lot of money saved or invested by then and  i will probably end up having to live with my future children.   i do not expect my retirement to be a very comfortable one full of cruises and golf.  it will most likely not be all that much fun.    >on january 31 and  1940 and  the first monthly retirement check was issued to ida may fuller of ludlow and  vermont and  in the amount of $22. 54.  miss fuller and  a legal secretary and  retired in november 1939.  she started collecting benefits in january 1940 at age 65 and lived to be 100 years old and  dying in 1975.   >ida may fuller worked for three years under the social security program.  the accumulated taxes on her salary during those three years was a total of $24. 75.  her initial monthly check was $22. 54.  during her lifetime she collected a total of $22 and 888. 92 in social security benefits.    . ssa. gov/history/idapayroll. html

i am 31,i can't run away and  since i am 31.  at my age i can't  i can move.    yes.  i think about moving all the time.   i would prefer to move to hawaii where i am actually treated fairly and people are actually nice to me for once.   i live in a city where japanese people are not treated so well.  i would prefer to move to hawaii where i would be treated prefer an equal for once. 
i am 65,saving money in the bank just is not a smart idea right now because of inflation and  plus near-zero interest rates.   you used to actually get some money in interest from your savings account  and  now you get less and less money every year because of inflation on your bank account.    i still think capitalism will exist in 34 years- when i am 65.  but i doubt social security will exist by then.   my money will be worth a lot less by then.   i do invest some of my money in the stock market and  and i am looking forward to the next crash so i can invest.    at the theatre where i work and  i hear old people saying that  that just shows you and  that if these people merely kept their money in the bank and  inflation would have just taken nearly all of it away. 
i am 31,yes i do.  i am 31 and  i have a face of an early 20s something.    i talked to a girl at a bar and  and she was prefer  rude fat girl. 
i am 15,i am 15 and on day 25 and  you give inspiration to keep on going.  the benefits i am feeling can only get better!
i am 16,i am 16 and i am almost at 100 days.  trust me when i say that pmo is a useless habit and quitting will make your life so much better. 
i am 15,i am 15 and when i got really into pmo i started to jack off to trans porn and eventually got into gay porn.  that was the breaking point which made me realize that i have to be serious about nofap.  i also noticed that i acted really strange around girls and i just had a creepy vibe.  the benefits have been a increase in confidence and  it's much easier to socialize with everyone and girls have been flirting with me a lot more.  i also do not have this cloud of shame with me now which makes it a lot easier to be myself around people. 
i am 16,i am 16 and it's been all good
i am 16,i am 16 and nofap has been great for me.  the difference is night and day. 
i am 16,i am 16 and most my friends do not get it but for some reason girls seem to understand. 
i am 16,i am 16 and every single one of those things will improve. 
i am 16,well i am 16 and i went six months recently.  the main thing for me was directing the sexual energy towards something else.  i would run at least a mile a day and  sometimes more.  i took cold showers only for the first few weeks but i think the main thing for you is to get over those feelings of shame and disgusting thoughts as those are separate from the physical and mental effects of porn. 
i am 16,well in the grand scheme of the things all those things you've mentioned are fears that have no basis in reality.  so what if most people are  as you put it.  they're all beautiful sparks of the divine.  we're all the source playing this grand game.  you mentioned that you are young.  i am 16 and i know it can get lonely sometimes but it's fine.  it really does not matter.  as you progress more and more unconscious beliefs get thrown out and life becomes so simple.  it already is so simple and  if you get rid of those fears and  you would see how beautiful it is. 
i am 16,i am 16 and all i can say is that everyone knows.  they just forgot that they know so they could come here.  they will all know in their own time :).  be careful with that sense of being superior.  i would invite to look into your heart for compassion and prefer for all beings.  make sure that all this stuff does​ not just become another identity. 
i am 501,currently crying at level 500 and  literally 1 more game and i am 501.  blizz please. 
i am 23,i am 23 and it doesn't work for me either.  yes when i am playing games or watching movies and  i can temporarily forget how i fucked up with my life.  but once i played enough or the movie finished and  i just feel worse because i know i should have been working on all the really important adult life problems but instead of that i just hide from them prefer a 5y kid.  i feel guilty and useless.  however if i do not do those i will just sit there and thinking about how unmotivated and lazy i am. 
i am 23,i can relate to this.  i was japanese major and i found i might chose wrong major in my third year.  i thought i will prefer japanese because i prefer manga and anime and j-pop.  but the more i learned the more i realized that i have no talent on language and  and japanese culture is way too different with my personality.   i was thinking  but when i graduated and trying to get a job and  i find out that corporations want some people who have some perferssional skills and can say japanese.  and when it comes to those jobs which need only japanese and  i am not good enough because there are so many extremely talented persons in my country trying to get a job too.  i am 23 now and still a neet who have know idea how am i going to pay my student loan.  i do not know what to do and want to do nothing.   sorry no advice for you and  just want you to know that you're not alone. 
i am 23,maybe you can move back in with your parents and find a part-time job? then you will have some time and money to learn a skill to help you find a real job.   i am 23 and i even have never get a job so i understand the feeling.  at least you worked before.    i hope you will be okay soon. 
i am 23,draw and  sleep and  watching youtube and  watching the same tv shows again and again and  seeking freelance jobs.   i applied a few full-time jobs and went to interviews before but all failed.  i am 23 now.  it have been almost one year since i graduated from uni. 
i am 23,all the same except i am 23.   daydreaming is just prefer drugs.  it makes you feel good when you're doing it and  makes you feel hopeless when you realized you did it again.  you know it's unhealthy but still feel it's prefer the only way out. 
i am 23,no and  its me become their responsibility.  well not really though since they can just kick me out and  but they're too kind to do that.  i am 23 and i am the failure in this house and  not the head of the household.   alan wake is really cool.  i think i can reach the end after my sister comes back home today. 
i am 23,same and  except i am 23 and have never get a job or in a relationship.  the worst part of all these is that you can barely find anyone to talk about this because everyone thinks losers just deserve it and you do not want to worry your family and  or even your family blames you too. 
i am 23,i am 23 and i feel the same.  it looks prefer everyone is growing up naturally except me. 
i am 23,happy birthday! i am 23 too.  i do not have a shitty job and  in fact and  i do not even have a job. 
i am 8,i fantasize that one day i wake up and find out that i am 8 again.  i will be the smart and cool kid and  all the classmates think i am awesome and my teachers and parents think i am smart but mysterious child.  i can learn more stuffs using all the time i used to play pc games and  and fix all the mistakes i have ever made. 
i am 23,me.  i am 23 but have never felt prefer an adult.  i am afraid of those people who look prefer a real adult. 
i am 23,i saw the title and thought .  clicked in and feel so relate to op.  i am 23 living at home and unemployed too.  always feel tired and  physically or mentally.  i am a lazy shit.  i can't even make myself apply a job per week.  you're so much better than me op.   i saw some people suggested taking one challenge at a time.  i tried that before and when i did it i did feel better for a while and  but then soon i fall into  trap and feel depressed again.  it's still a good advice i mean and  but op if it doesn't work on you do not feel your doomed or something.  it doesn't work well on me either. 
i am 23,almost same except i am 23 and i have a degree which is basically useless because i do not actually have that knowledge and skills.  at this point i believe they just delete my resume right after they saw i have never had a job.  i am not even disability and  i think i am simply just a lazy and  worthless and  useless person.  weak and stupid.  to get a job you're either strong or smart and  but i can't stand for 8 hours nor actually learn something by studying it for 4 years.  still have no idea for what to do next and  and i do not even want to think about it. 
i am 18,6:  -friends that i know from school and they're my age and mostly drink together   -my older brothers friends that became my friends as well   - my neighbour and few other guys including my oldest brother.  we mostly do some heavy drinking together about once a week.   -older guy that runs some of the things around the town and his mates.   -my older brothers best friend and his group  -friends from neighbouring cities and people i met there  i am 18 and most of the time i hang out with people older than me . 
i am 11,it does not pay well.  you get a little over minimum wage and  plus 3 dollars for every day you stay in the park  you do get 25 cents every year you come back and it is easier to get into management positions if you are willing to try.  if you are good at saving you can save up quite lot.    last summer i did make $12. 75 an hour because it was the parks 100th.  i also worked 6 day a week 12 hr a day for three months so i made back with that.  currently i am $11 hr but i have been here for about 7 years and have an office job  this also does not include employee benefits. 
i am 23,i am decently good looking prefer maybe average and i am still neet.  i imagine if i were to work out and start taking care of myself i would have more girls but even now i've had a bunch of girlfriends just not many that have lasted that long .  was a pretty late bloomer when it came to sex did not have sex till my 19th birthday but after that it just seemed to happen more easily.  i am 23 now and have had sex with 9 different girls but right now i am single and lonely just cant seem to get motivated to put in the work to have a long term relationship .  just get some confidence and you'll be good its a lot easier than it seems just do your own thing and not care what other people are doing/saying.  eventually you'll find someone you just have to put yourself in enough social situations which is not exactly easy for neets. 
i am 29,i am 29 and i never really think about it.  i just go about my life. 
i am 29,i am 29 and an undergrad tranfer.  means little to me.  it helps  that i look almost a good 10 years younger than my age. 
i am 28,i am 28 and a year away from a ba.   you're at an advantage over the kids.  the foolishness is behind you and  you know what's important. 
i am 28,i am 28 which is enough to see a difference with the maturity levels.  i am friends with my professors and most of them consider me to be their favorite student. 
i am 28,i am 28.  but i look 21 so no one notices.   not that it'd matter anyway. 
i am 28,i am 28 and you might still outlive me.   just live day by day and make the most of it.   trying to make that my philosophy. 
i am 28,i am 28 and i do not see them much.  i was not raised religious.  but they're so up their own asses with how religious and rich they are.  eh.  i just do not prefer the concept of an ascribed status.  i guess i am just being an ass but that doesn't make me happy or proud.   yeah and  i will sort my issues out one way or another. 
i am 23,as mentioned elsewhere in the thread and  i am 23. 
i am 23,yeah and  and a lot of little girls of certain age ranges do prefer them.   and some teenagers and adults and  actually !  the ceramic tea sets also sound actually pretty nice quality-wise and  and expensive.   i am 23 and i would still *prefer* both of these gifts.     the point is and  i feel prefer these gifts were perfectly fair and  based on fair assumptions--gender stereotypical and  sure and  and if your sisters were not into those types of things it's not very thoughtful--but still and  these are not really . 
i am 23,odd question and  but interestingly i do and  and i was just wondering about this the other day.   i am 23 and  and i've been neet for almost three years .   recently i've been noticing a surprising  amount of silver hair for someone my age.   not that it has anything to do with neet status necessarily--i suspect it's just attributable to poor mental health and experiencing severe stress/trauma over the past several years. 
i am 14,im14andidontgetit  seriously i am 14. 8 yo and i do not get this ;_;
i am 40,maturity-wise i feel prefer i am still prefer 16.   i physically look prefer i am 40 and i have the energy levels of a 60 year old.   i am 30 years old. 
i am 30,maturity-wise i feel prefer i am still prefer 16.   i physically look prefer i am 40 and i have the energy levels of a 60 year old.   i am 30 years old. 
i am 30,i am 30 and i am not even *receding* anymore and  i am just straight up *bald*.   the good thing is if you're not trying to impress or attract anyone and  you stop caring.   i first realized i was receding my last year of high school when someone pointed it out after i got a haircut.   i was depressed about it for a while but by the time i was 19 i stopped caring. 
i am 30,i do not even know what i would put on a resume.   i've never made one in my life.   i am 30 years old and have worked less than 2 weeks in my life.   since i only lasted a couple days at one job and a week at the other and  putting my work experience would make me look even worse.   the first job i had was at mcdonalds and they did not even ask for a resume.   the second and last job i had i got through a temp agency.   i started on very short notice because they needed people urgently so i managed to get in without a resume but the temp agency kept e-mailing me asking for my resume saying the company i was working for was requesting it.   i just quit after a week. 
i am 30,i am 30.   i feel old but at the same time i do not feel prefer an adult and  if that makes sense.   my mental age is probably somewhere around 17. 
i am 24,lol damn and  ive  spent some already.  i am 24
i am 32,i am 32 and  i used to think that one day the technology would exist  to cure my ugliness/deformities and allow me to live the youth i never had.  since my late teens i had been calorie restricting and taking 10+ supplements each day to slow the aging process.  in the last couple of years and  it hit me prefer a bus that it was all for nothing. 
i am 19,i am 19.  i remember hearing and still am hearing about porn.  the problem is that almost all of these people have never researched the effects of porn.  they are inside of the system.  many are ignorant.  and even if they do research and  many will try and justify their actions.   moderation for an addict is nigh impossible.  that's why we're called addicts.  we can't moderate our shit.  best practice is to go cold turkey.  when you accept you will never pmo and  prefer never ever and  it will help start the catalyst for change. 
i am 5,>but overall there is not anything i can do about it.  i just laugh about it and make jokes about it to everyone else.  i power on and just say fuck it and keep going.   how? do not you feel  about that? i just feel prefer i am self depreciating and it annoys the fuck out of me.    >as for dating and what not and  i've slept with a handful of women.  i started at 22 and  so barely 2 years ago i lodt my virginity.  one i am seeing now doesn't give a shit i stutter.  she sees me as some  sexual deviant always putting a new notch on my belt.  i do not know but just pretending and acting to be prefer that has helped me.  not giving a fuck about the stutter has helped too with women too.  learn to ignore the looks people give you.  everyone will give you that  look.  its natural and  hardly anyone meets someone who stutters.  ive only ever met one myself.    that's pretty uplifting to hear.  do    >my last encounter i slept with some girl within an hour of meeting her.  never done that before and  and i barely said more than 4 sentences to her.  i am not the best looking guy and  i am just fit and maybe an average face at best.  maybe it was right place at the right time but i am not complaining.  felt alpha as fuck and  some rp principles worked too.    hmm.  what are your stats? i am 5'11 170 15% boyfriend.  also what rp principles are we talking about here that worked? the only thing that i can say has helped me is lifting which gives me some stares from women from time to time.  i am too pussy too approach still.    >easiest way to meet women is to have a good group of friends.  find a job/hobby that'll make it easy for you to make friends.  those friends in turn introduce you to girls and just do not act prefer an incel piece of shit and you're good for the most part.  for me and  it was the military and now my leo job that helped me make a good network of friends.    ahhh lucky you man.  my workplace is all old farts who play golf.  i have currently maybe 1-2 friends i talk to regularly and even they would not ever talk to me if i stopped messaging them tomorrow.  i am currently looking for more hobbies too though.  have any good suggestions?   also would you mind if i messaged you from time to time for dating advice?
i am 22,look i am 22 and even though life is not great now it's still much much better then when i was 18.     if you were 35 i would've said different and  but at 18 i can almost garuntee and promise you that life gets better.  keep going and strive hard. 
i am 22,playing soccer.  i was pretty good up until i was 16.  then i injured myself a bunch and got fat.  when i try playing now i barely look prefer i've ever touched a ball.  i am 22.  i lost all my cardio and game sense. 
i am 22,you have friends.  they care enough to hang out with you and invite you out places even if it's just getting drunk/high.  you have a guy who loves and appreciates you.  point is  you do not  have notjing.  you have alot.  alot of peopl prefer you and that's more then many many people here can say.  i most certainly can't.  nobody has contacted me since last december and i do not see any hope or anything changing.  i've never been with a woman and i do not know if that'll ever change i am 22.  plus there are people alot worse then me in poorer parts of the world.  they have even less hope and chance for change.  but they survive.     and despite my own situation y ou know what even then i try and find meaning somewhere and try my best everyday to make something out of it all.  i get those negative thoughts too but i block them out in my head.  they are not me.  there just thoughts and brain signals that hold no inherent meaning.  besides that and  i work out and  i read and  i apply for jobs in different cities etc.  i try not to focus on them.  sorry if it seems prefer i am making this about myself i just find i know myself best and can relate that aspect with others.    but yeah.  try not thinking about it too much for the time being.  talk to a therapist that would definitely help too. 
i am 22,"> i am pretty sure you've heard of bad"" and also expected to be dtf 24/7.   good point.  i did not consider it prefer that.  i've only seen it from the male perspective so my observation is pretty skewed.     >question:  how do you know that you're not presenting yourself even now as someone who has a hard time chilling?  how do you know that the people who talk about school work with you are not doing that because that is *specifically* what they need/want from you?  you want to meet people for social things do not do it under the guise of a study session.     i mean i try to be a chill person to the best of my ability and as much as it comes naturally.  if any other conclusion besides stereotyping it's that maybe i am not inherently good enough or my skills lack so badly that it's close to not having it all.   as for your second point and  no i disagree completely.  tons of people meet and socialize during study sessions.  i've made many friends through study sessions and socializing outside of schoolwork during those sessions.  you can and should do both.  the mia purpose should be to socialize but i would not leave it out completely.  in study sessions where i have not socialized i've experienced the most amount of stereotyping in my experience.    >if you're twenty you had a chance when you went off to college to create a brand new impression in people's minds.   you left high school behind and you could have come off as someone to chill with and  someone fun.   but you are repeating the same pattern.    i was too dumb and naiive at that time.  i was also deeply a part of the incel community and what not.  i am not anymore and only recently have improved somewhat.  i am 22 and only have 3 semesters of college left.  maybe it's too late i do not know.  my fault i get it but i am trying.     >this is not something women are doing to you and  this is something you are doing to yourself.   i strongly suggest you will try and find out what it is you're doing and change that.   and that probably means saying no to women who want you specifically as a study partner.    good point.  i am trying to test out nowadays what works and what doesn't work.    >those women are not interested in dating you and it has nothing to do with stereotyping you.   they're just not attracted.   yeah that's probably the case for 80-90% of the reason.  there is still a  a small element of stereotyping or establishing preconceived notions though and that's out of my control. "
i am 6,>what else do you bring to the table? do you have a decent job? are you interesting to talk to? you have a stutter and you say you are below average in terms of looks.  that's life man.  life can be a bitch but you have to deal.  also and  i guarantee you that there changes you can make that will make you more attractive to women.  how can you judge a woman's level of insecurity by the direction she swipes on a dating app? do you personally know many hot women? also what is with the infatuation with  what about decent looking women.      i am a student at a decent university.  i am  6'0.  i lift and in shape.  i am not that interesting to talk to because of my stutter rleople think i am retarded.  but my closest friends find me fascinating and fun to talk to.    i do not have an infatuation with hot women.  i tried tinder and never got a single match that did not unmatch me within an hour.  i personally know a couple of girls but they do not consider me cool enough to hang out with i guess.     thanks for your encouragement but i do not think there is alot you can do to help.  besides i've  accepted that ill die alone and i am not nessacarily sad about that. 
i am 22,i've got a history with this shit.  its possible to beat it man.  i am 22 and much worse then you.  but never let the external world dictate the internal.  if i can have hope you can too. 
i am 22,>lol and  how old are you?    i am 22.    >i can easily tell from your attitude towards how you describe “other things” that you don’t really care about school or anything else and  furthermore your entire philosophy on life isn’t nihilism and  seeing as you actually extrapolate meaning out of things.  true nihilism means that everything is meaningless and  even that relationship you’re pining for.      do you really know that from just my attitude huh? that just shows me how awful your judgement is and how little you know what your talking about.   again i said it was my version of nihilism.  i do not care what the original version was or if mine fits it perfectly or not.  i do not find intrinsic meaning or purpose in life besides maximizing pleasure and doing well at whatever i do.  work hard party harder fuck the rest.  that's the motto i live by.  that's all anyone can do really.    >also i am pretty sure that you’re not emotionally invested into anything else and  if you are and  go ahead and prove me wrong by telling me in great details about your other hobbies.  though i sincerely doubt you will because you’re not as invested in them as you are with “trying to get laid or complaining about not getting laid” and probably only took them up shallowly in an attempt to get girls.      ok.  i enjoyed going to the gym and lifting weight and got really invested into it.  yes a part of it was to get women but i soon realized it did not do shit and with my genetic limitatjons and unwillingness to inject steroids i am severley limited.  yet i still continue.   i played soccer and really liked jt but i soon stooped because i did not have time and nobody around me shared that interest.  i was on my own watching games and it was pointless.   i am thinking about taking some dance classes and yeah part of it is absafuckingloutely to have more interactions with women.  and i think i will eventually succeed given enough interactions.  does that make me a bad person? fuck no.  that's why alot of guys do it.  according to dr jordan peterson that's why alot of guys do most productive things ever.  but no i am not allowed to have that intention.  the only reason your coming down on me in particular is because you have a hate against virgin socially rejected men.   but dude it's so fucking easy for you to sit there and say this shit.  you've never known what it's prefer to be socially outcast and ridiculed your entire life.  all of your dumbass hobbies you took up cause it just naturally happened for you and the rest of your friends were doing them or whatever.  do not even say you took them out of some pure prefer of the craft  motive.  bullshit.  you had ulterior motives too.     >what your philosophy is essentially “sour grapes” where if you fail at getting one thing you hate it and  even though this flawed logic has been called out **2000 years ago by aesop**.  do you honestly believe that you can ever achieve anything by not failing and trying?   i have not gotten women.  do i hate women? no.  i would not be asking for sled improvement advice to do better with women if i did.     > success is literally defined by failing enough times but never giving up until eventually you get it right.  > >also and  prefer i said and  no one outside of high school cares about things prefer “social hierarchy” as “being undesirable or datable” really don’t matter in the real world.       they do matter though.  try asking a janitor and  an engineer and  a night club owner and ryan gosling how much they get laid.  they're answers will vary wildly due to their position on the hierarchy pyramid. 
i am 22,look outwards too.  do not depend just on improving yourself.  accept your faults and interact with people of all kinds.  i am 22 and in the same probably worse situation as you. 
i am 29,>why less likely and  do you know its prefer to be judged on abitlity to do your job because of your gender only and  women in most countries have men looking after their health cares and  i am my country the foetus has the right to life same as the mother and  we have to deal with losing our job or being stigmitised for being an at home mom   that is rapidly changing though.  more and more women are getting into positions of power.  i do think it sucks that you get told what to do by men in power but i do not think there a societal hate towards women as a whole by people other then those old dudes in power.  there is not a sense of alienation prefer there is for men.  women have hope and something to look forward to.  men do not.  this a great video by dr.  jordan peterson explaining this sense amongst men.   . be/5er1loarlgg    >women are not sending you to war and  that would be the government who are mostly made up of old white men and  as for the massive suicide and  you are aware women attempt suicide at the same rate as men they are not as sucsussfel mostly down the method men tend to pick guns or jumping off buildings and  women tend to go for pills and our bodies deal with chemical imbalances better than men.    i have not heard of that hypotheses on suicide but it seems interesting.  i will look into that.   >do you geniunly believe sex is all people need to have a happy be told their pretty and a lot of matches on dating sites that leads to sex.     no that's not what i believe at all.  having social validation and knowing you are not an undesirable outcast is pretty fucking awesome.  you probably strive for that too yourself.  if i told you to abandon all hope and become a cat lady you won't do that.  if i wanted sex i would just get an escort and  less of a hassle.    >what do you think will change in you should the sex start happening?   again not sex.  but a feeling of being accepted and not being an outcast.  what would change if that would happen? i do not know.  alot.  i would be less pissed off and not frequent incels as much.  i would not have a  disdain for people.  most of all i would feel confident in my ability because i would have evidence to back up me saying  .  if i say that in the presence of no results it doesn't make sense.  so yeah results matter.    >all genuine questions put foward with no ill intent or suggestion against your view am intrigued and  prefer how do you feel knowing i am a girl would you use terms prefer thot or femoid or stacey ?    no.  why would i do that?      >one last point i am 29 and have 62 follwers not all women get massive following and  but how does it make life easier for women its fake karma/thumbs/likes that exsist only online    you know you are not a social outcast.  you have some external validation.  i would not even get 6 followers on instagram.  that's the case for the bottom 30% of most men. 
i am 22,i am 22.  the amount of anxiety i have is unfathomable and i too think it's over. 
i am 21,man loneliness is such a killer.  are there some group activities you can do to make friends?    try hooking up at bars or clubs or dating apps just to raise eyour confidence initially.  once you get over that hurdle i feel prefer things will become a heck of a lot easier.     i am 21 and in the same position as you .  i know it's not too late for me but hoenstly fear being in the same position as you so i am trying my best to turn things around right now. 
i am 6,short guys can't build as good of a figure as tall guys without looking cartoonish or manlet.    i am 6'0 and skinny but i've got bigger limbs and an infinitely better physique theneone who's 5'4 and has a similar build to me.  my bones and muscles are just genetically bigger.  if that short guy works out  and  he'll look prefer a manlet when he actually gets to a point where he can dwarf me.  so in a competitive world a 6'0 guy would almost always be preferable to a 5'4 guy.  
i am 21,first of all thank you for your response and taking time on a holiday to write all this out.  i guess it helped give prespective on some points.    >sounds prefer you did not have control over your thoughts and were spiraling.  have you tried practicing ? there is an app called  where you can practice some sessions for free.    this helped me alot.  i downloaded headspace and did practice it every now and then.     >life and success is not just about money.  also  and  what makes you think you would have made it through pre-med and med school? it's not a walk in the park.  you need to have a high gpa to move forward through the programs and be accepted to med school.     that's the thing though.  i know i could've.  i definitely could have gotten the high premed gpa and  the high mcat score and  the whatever else you need.  i know i have the grit and the determination especially when my mind is clear to absolutely do well    >on social skills and  and it takes time.  though and  one tip and  you won't be very successful getting a girlfriend until you can be successful being happy with friends.    exactly.  its over then.  i am 21.  if i have not figured out how to make friends yet there's something wrong with me which makes people feel uncomfortable around me.  if i have not figured it out yet i do not think i am getting anywhere in a long term relationship.  its over.    >so and  what and  this is just a reason to stagnate at the age of probably <25 years old and just say  you're young.  you have a lot of room for self improvement before you give up on women.  if you were a woman and  would you date you? would you date a woman who had all the qualities you have? become somebody you'd want to date.  a romantic partner is a garnish to a happy life and  not the main entree.     i guess that's a good way to look at it.  i try and be happy without women but in reality i know deep down i cant become that person women want.  being ugly+adhd+speech impediment that makes me not be able to speak more then 4 words is indeed a very shit fucking hand.  if i was a women i would not date me.  not now not ever cause i do not think alot of the things that can be self improved can fix permenant problems.    >you were dreaming big and perhaps a bit naive.  that doesn't mean it's the end of the world.  do not depend on your job or others to make you happy.  work on yourself.  otherwise you'll always be unhappy.    yeah i agree with you on that.  ive  given up on others and work to make me happy.  having said that however having either of those is better then being alone.  having others is not an option so work will have to do for me.    >check out /r/personalfinance and /r/financialindependence.  that's plenty of money to be happy and  and it's better than mediocre.  it's above the average ***household*** income in america.    i disagree with this point completely.  no.  $65-95k is nothing.  i want more.  we all should want more.  my cpa uncle gets $150k in bonuse.  bankers and lawyers do not have to worry about getting a measly $5k raise  cause they know it doesn't mean shit.  it just is not fair.  we make crap money for the effort we put in for engineering when we could've put in the same effort for something prefer medicine that actually would've paid me more.    >there are plenty of people on this subreddit with sub 2. 8 gpas who get jobs.  look around.     i can get a job of course.  i meant grad school.  mba and  law and stuff.  what's the point becoming a fat cubicle nerd doing math for $65k while these white collars are making $300k snorting coke off of pornstars tits.    >this is on you.  people do not adore lawyers or businessmen  because of their professions.  it's their job.  personal growth and personality is all on you to develop.  you have to put in effort to join into society.  yeah and  society sucks and  but if you want to be a part you have to pay in.  be nice and  put in effort and  learn the social rules.  it's not going to be handed to you on a silver platter.  it did not get handed to most of the rest of us either.      i highly recommend you check out r/theredpill.  i can .  fuck i already do all that anyways.  but money and  status and  power are all what matter in this world.  i mean fuck just look at donald trump.  everyone else is just playing catch up to the big dogs.   >**these are really good things.  really good.  focus on this. ** you've already encountered great success! things are on the mend! you can succeed past your past.    thank you i hope so too.   >no.  do not do this.  grow as a person otherwise your personal life won't grow.     its already stagnant and probably not changing but i see your point.     >or get some hobbies and  go outside and  meet people and  practice your social skills and  and create your smiling vibrant life with your own hands.    that's the best most honest advice you've given here.  i just hope my attempts do not end if failure again prefer they previously have.     >you're giving up too soon.  if you're willing to work for a dog for money that won't even make you happy and  why not work prefer a dog on yourself? join a team sport.  join a fitness class.  pick up a hobby or three.  you're not going to grow alone and  in a dark room.  you can do this.  you have so much potential.  do not short change yourself.     good point.  i still think  a shit ton of money will make me more happy but honestly i have not had personal life success so i could totally be wrong.       once again thank you for taking the time for this response and happy new year. 
i am 22,i am 22 and i definitely can't help you since i struggle with most of what you did as well and because of your age and life experience you have a lot more wisdom and insight at dealing with stuff then i do.  i would prefer to hear others responses though.   if you do not mind however i would prefer to ask if you could go back to your twenties and give advice what would it be? what advice would you give regarding getting a decent career and  financial success and a fulfilling social life specifically?
i am 21,i cant tell you what happens if you do anything about it but i can tell you what happens if you do not do anything about it prefer me.    basically you just live the same day over and over and over again.  i am 21 and that's what happened to me.  my life hasn't drastically changed since i was 17 because those fuck ups i did up till i was 19 will stick with me forever.    change now or you will most certainly regret it later.  use the fear of living this  worthless life 5 years from now as motivation to do something.  cause man does time fly and it honestly gives no fuck.    so yeah.  if anything take my failures and fucking up when i was 17 as motivation for you to succeed. 
i am 22,getting a girl.     i got in shape and became more descent looking and developed a nicer voice.      i am 22 and i have no fucking clue what to do except hitting up random clubs alone and using tinder.  so far no success.  i've been trying to browse r/seduction but i suck so bad atm that a lot of the advice doesn't apply.  i feel so far behind that it's all pretty pie in the sky right now.   god i hope things change. 
i am 21,∆ ok.  you have partially cmv with certain points you made:   fair point in saying that there are depressed people who do meet the 4 criteria and happy people who do not meet any of the 4 criteria.    the other person i agreed with also mentioned this.  why do you think that is the case and what makes it so?  i cmv on being socially popular.  being c-list is probably a bit much.  however it does help having a core group of friends though and that is exactly what i lack atm.  perhaps that would fix alot of my problems.   i have not cmv on being able to date an abundance of women.  maybe its casue i am 21 and  but i just do not see alot of downsides.   ive partially cmv on habing alot of money.  other things probably matter more and throwing yourself into a personal pursuit is indeed very fulfilling.  having a safety net is nice though and that is still something ill pursue. 
i am 175,i totally get what it's prefer using food as comfort for bad stuff in life.  i ballooned from 145 to 200 in an year doing so.    what i learned really helped me was to prep all my weeks meals on a sunday.  i saved such an enormous amount of time and money doing so.  not buying snacks is another big one.    also remeber that it's a lifelong journey of improvement and there will be lots of ups and downs.  2 months ago i was 160 and now i am 175.  it doesn't mean its over and ill just gain gorever.  in facg it doesnt bother me though cause i realize that it's a journey and as long as i have that mindset i have the capability to get back to that easily.    good luck. 
i am 22,why could not you have enjoyed them more if i may ask?  cause i am 22 and i feel the same. 
i am 21,oh bc yaad mat dilao pakistan.  it's caused me such tremendous pain in terms of not being able to interact with women i can't even begin to explain.  i've missed out on so much in life cause of this.  i am 21 and just now figuring out how to date.    i probably would've turned gay prefer prisoners turn gay had i stayed in pak.   the most self castrating country of all time. 
i am 22,i am 22 and already feel this way.   but honestly it's something that doesn't bother me a whole bunch.  i did not have the information or understanding to have had things go differently when i was younger.  i will get over it  and  cause you look around and you'll see that most people do not have their shit together despite how many women prefer them. 
i am 5,i am 5’10 with boots and i am taller than most people. 
i am 23,idk.  i am 23 and have a 28 year old who's been in for almost 8 years and can't get his shit together.  whole unit hates him and  fails every test you give him and needs a retest and  bitches constantly and  and tries to tell me how much better he is than everyone . 
i am 6,i am 6 ft and  so not super tall and  but working medical for 5 years and  i've seen all body types.  granted and  the taller you are and  the harder it can be to put bulk muscle on and  but it doesn't automatically make you have a thick waist.  that's poor diet and lack of cardio.  i've seen dudes who are 6'6 with skinny waists and  and dudes sitting at 5'6 who was begging for a waist waiver since he was trying to have the strongman build.  you have to play to your body type on the test.  tall dudes run faster easier and  but suffer more on pushups and  where short dudes are the opposite typically.  i have no sympathy for people who bitch about ac when it's the easiest one to pass  and  and easiest to check and see if you're good. 
i am 240,yeah and  i am 240 lbs @ 5'9.  i had the same symptoms as you.   i should also mention that i am a mouthbreather and  my tongue is too big for my mouth and  and i gained weight around my neck and  which are all huge risk factors for sleep apnea.    when you are unable to breathe through your nose and  you end up mouthbreathing.  this means that your tongue doesn't rest at the roof of your mouth and  which is supposed to push your face forwards for healthy facial development.  your facial features  end up being recessed.  however and  your tongue will continue to grow and  and will end up being too big to rest at the roof of your mouth.  this means that during sleep and  it will inevitably drop back into your throat and  blocking your airway.    when you gain weight around your neck and  the fatty tissues constrict the airway.  this and  in combination with tongue blockage and  will create a severe case of sleep apnea.   not everyone who is obese has sleep apnea.  for example and  obese people who have robust facial development and gain weight in their midsection and  as opposed to their neck and other body parts and  are at a much lesser risk of developing sleep apnea.  even if they do and  it is usually not as severe as people who mouthbreathe and have fat necks. 
i am 21,i am 21.  i second haleythepooh. 
i am 32,i am 32 and it hasn't happened. 
i am 32,i am 32 years old. 
i am 33,seconded.  i am 33 and we play board games weekly and are ridiculous around one another.  sure and  we bother each other for things that might seem childish and  but it's out of prefer and  really.  if you can't hurt your friends and  who can you hurt?
i am 22,i am 22 and  the girlfriend thing is complicated  and  traumatic .   what should i do? masturbate without porm?
i am 188,i always get uncomfortable when on formal events because many girls are my height or taller on heels.   i am 188 cm
i am 17,great article! i am 17 and i know what is he talking about.  especially when he mentioned the virus pop up ad and  hahah
i am 22,i am 22 and i feel prefer i am 17.  it's to the point that a lot of the time when somebody asks my age and  i have to pause and remember not to say 17.  i probably feel that way because that was the age i last attended school before i dropped out.   when i turned 20 and told my psychologist and  she admitted that i come off as being a 13 year old.  yikes. 
i am 17,i am 22 and i feel prefer i am 17.  it's to the point that a lot of the time when somebody asks my age and  i have to pause and remember not to say 17.  i probably feel that way because that was the age i last attended school before i dropped out.   when i turned 20 and told my psychologist and  she admitted that i come off as being a 13 year old.  yikes. 
i am 22,i totally feel you on getting upset about seeing your cousin doing so well.  my cousins are all significantly older than me and they're all married with kids  and have careers.  i would never wish any hardships on them at all but i definitely feel very jealous and even angry that their lives are seemingly going great and i had to be the screw up of the bunch.   the embarrassment and shame is very real.  i hate going to get my haircut and  meeting new people and  or even just seeing some of my parent's old friends because i always get dragged into conversations about school.  i either end up saying that i do not know what i want to do or i am dealing with health issues that prevent me from going to school .  it was fine when i said these back when i was 18 but people give me weird looks now that i am 22 and i still do not have my life figured out.  even worse and  after they find out i am not in school they ask me about the job i  must have.  ugh.  i am still saying that i babysit even though i have not done it in years.    my future is not looking so great either.  when my parents die i will have nothing.  i would literally become homeless and that's the thing that has consistently scared me.  i would not want to ruin my brother's life by forcing myself to stay with him  and i am not close to my extended family.  my parents had me when they were in their mid to late thirties so they are not exactly spring chickens right now.  i would have to kill myself because i do not want to be that homeless woman everyone sees on the street and also because i prefer them sososo much i could not function without them.  i depend on them for everything. 
i am 22,a girl i had a crush in middle school/freshmen year.  she thought i was funny and  and she really seemed to prefer me.  i did not know i liked her until i moved schools in 8th grade.  i went to school with her again in the 9th grade and i was too afraid to tell her how i felt.  i did not think she actually liked me and i was afraid of rejection.  i moved states and that was the start of a deep spiraling depression.  i could not think about any other girl after that.  i am 22 and i am over it and  but i still have dreams about her.  #creepy  i do not know if i am an infj/infp/intp/istj or something completely different. 
i am 50,i do not know and  i was but it's prefer i am 50 different types.  it's just not worth the energy because i agree with all of them but i mostly relate to infp and intp.  i am just going to take a break from it and  it's driving me nuts. 
i am 22,1. be happy  2. do not waste any more of my life doing things just to do them .  i am 22 years old now and have already wasted too much of my time playing games and  and mostly because i did not want to deal with real life.     3. convert my source of fun from games/little things to achieving my goals.    4. eat food to enjoy life and  not to enjoy the food i am eating    5. goals in the gym: 225 bench press/225 squat/315 deadlift for reps and  but most of all enjoy working out.     6. learn javascript this month  7. get a job in web development soon  8. do something with my art prefer make comics or speedpaint vids  9. become a video game artist   10. someday learn to make trance/club music. 
i am 22,i am 22 and i've thought about joining the military for a long time as well but i just can't get myself to do it and  i could not put my life on the line for something i do not even care for.    for me joining the military sounded great and  free school and  free housing and  independence and  benefits and  learning a trade and  making new friends and  seeing new places and  and doing something with the next 3 years of my life.  but i can't convince myself to join because first and foremost joining the military is to serve the country not myself and  and even though i am living in america it's not exactly my home and  i could live in any country and feel the same.     i support anyone who wants to join and  the military is probably a great choice for most people that do not know what to do. 
i am 23,not sure if i should proceed with programming and  do not really enjoy it but i do not really enjoy anything and i am 23. 
i am 5,i never gave my height much consideration and  maybe because i am 5'8 and  i always knew there were tall guys but i never felt abnormally short.  now i wonder how much my height has played a role in my unattractiveness. 
i am 50,>memes have not been funny since the rage comic days.   i think it's more of the fact that we are getting older.  i absolutely detested rage comics when you enjoyed them and  but i used to enjoy some of the pre-reddit ones.  i liked memes when ytmnd was still relevant and 4chan was starting to get popular and  but looking back and  most of those jokes were really fucking awful.   nowadays i do not even fully understand memes anymore.  the term has gotten so god damned broad it gives me a headache just thinking about it.  when someone claims to be shitposting or memeing i am prefer  i feel left out and it's frustrating as hell.  i am only 27 and  i shouldn't feel prefer i am 50. 
i am 22,i am 22 and  virgin and  obese and pretty ugly.  also sit at home spending half the time playing games or browsing reddit/youtube.  other half i lay in bed trying to sleep or thinking about what a fucking loser i am.  i graduated about half a year ago but have not got a job since then and  only worked retail before and quit after a few months.  socially anxious and i try to tell myself no one cares how i talk or look in public but i always get nervous no matter what.  can't talk to people normally at all and  i just stutter and sound prefer an idiot.  trying to break this depressing cycle by exercising but i do not stay consistent and do not really feel much more confident at all.    i am such a damn failure. 
i am 23,thanks for ur long reply.    yes i am 23.  i tried to attempt last year and  but i am too much of a pussy to go through with it.  you mentioned you've been in this position before  and  prefer what did you focus on and do to get through all this.    the next part is what i do not get and  i put in so much effort into appearance and  i watch caloric intake etc and  workout 4 days a week.  but upon seeing my ethnic face i am instantly disregarded .  at my current internship i do meet a lot of women and  but understandably they treat someone prefer me objectively at all times.  but it hurts when i see the same women completely drop their guard and  be flirtatious and make plans for dinners/ gatherings with my white male colleagues .  prefer what more can i do?
i am 30,right? i am 30 and can't wait for the divorces to start rolling in. 
i am 23,i am just worried about being seen as disgrace i am 23
i am 23,i just feel bad that i am 23 and have nothing to show for it
i am 21,i am almost 22 and i constantly feel prefer my awkward 14 y teenage self at all times and  just with shorter hair and less weeb-ish.  no one believes me when i say i am 21.  they think i am 15.    i do not know how to connect to other people my own age and  since they're all doing good at their jobs and  studying in universities and living on their own.  i am frozen here. 
i am 15,i am almost 22 and i constantly feel prefer my awkward 14 y teenage self at all times and  just with shorter hair and less weeb-ish.  no one believes me when i say i am 21.  they think i am 15.    i do not know how to connect to other people my own age and  since they're all doing good at their jobs and  studying in universities and living on their own.  i am frozen here. 
i am 21,i have not had a job for a year and i have been working since i was 15.  i am 21 now.  it was part time and really long hours in various service jobs and whoa i do not miss it and  but i miss the money. 
i am 30,i am 30 and  i live with my parents who support me financially and i run a small sole proprietorship type of company from my room and  but it is not too successful.  i guess it probably disquallifies me as a neet and  but technically i am still not employed by anyone and  and overall i live a pretty neet prefer style: i do not leave the house much and  i get up late and  i mostly watch tv and browse the internet etc. 
i am 30,i am 30 and i would say it bothers me much less than when i was 25 and  but i was always pretty asocial to begin with. 
i am 30,i am 30 and i have noticed my sex drive started dropping about a year or two ago and  which i think is a good thing.  i never liked alcohol in the first place and  though. 
i am 31,i am  worried what will happen when i am old and weak without having anyone to help me and  or that i will spend the rest of my life regretting not doing something about it.  right now i am 31 and i regret most of things i did ten years ago and  but only some of them have anything to do with me being fa. 
i am 31,funny and  i am 31 and at this point i have just gotten used to being alone and  it's been going on for so long that i pretty much can't imagine any other life.  even my plans for the future are built around the idea of still being alone - few years from now i would prefer to move out to my own two room apartment with kitchen and bathroom where one room would be my cozy bedroom with comfy bed and  big tv and lots of books and dvds whereas i would convert the other one into my own private home office and  complete with a computer desk and  office supplies and even a mini-lounge for one in the corner where i would have coffee and shit during breaks.  i think i am just slowly going nuts. 
i am 25,well as i said and  i am 25.    why do you need to know this? . _. 
i am 25,what channel is the show on? is it on youtube?  the fact that i am a cat person is a huge problem- not only in dating and  but even friendships.  most people only trust dog people and hate cats.  even on dating sites and  most people list that in their profiles.  makes it easy to know who to avoid and  i guess.    my mom loves both and  but dogs more.  she had a dog for 15 years.  the dog died when i was prefer 4.  so i do not really remember her.  but my dad says horrible things about her.  he said that my mom did not train her properly at all and she was out of control and terribly behaved.  .   my mom and  of course and  doesn't remember any of that.  all she talks about is how great the dog was.  i am 25 now and she still brings up this dog several times a week.  has a little  in her bedroom with the dog's photos and  toys and  leash and  etc.  and it's only gotten worse after my step-dad died last year.   she really wants to get a dog again .  but i know it won't end well.  she did exactly what you said- had a psychological blind spot.   she did the same with her kids.  hate to say it.  she'd always tell me how smart and handsome and talented i am.  i am none of those things.  she'd make up lies about us to seem prefer a good parent.  it was awful.  took me long enough to realize it.    but yeah and  let's pray she doesn't get a dog again. 
i am 25,i am 25 and it doesn't get better.  :(
i am 25,>and of course and  the older guys who actively go after much younger partners are often to messy for more mature guys to tolerate.   damn i want to print this out and fame it.  i am 25 and holy fuck it's so true.  the guys who have gone after me since i came out at 18 have been a mess. 
i am 54,> on apps i am 54 and  not my actual 63.   sorry but.  fuck off with that.  it's so annoying when guys lie about their age. 
i am 25,man and  all these 20-somethings on here who say they desperately want an older guy.  can we trade places? ;-;  i am 25 and live in old redneck territory and desperately want a younger guy and  but there's prefer none near me. 
i am 5,"i am 5'6"" and even got told i looked prefer a hobbit >. > so yeah i guess"
i am 5,"lmao i am 5'6"" with a 34 waist ;-; i was never a 28 though.  30 at my lowest. "
i am 25,i am 25. 
i am 25,well i've been a nintendo fan my whole life.  i am 25.  and they're all ages from 18 to 40 ;-;
i am 25,i am 25 and same
i am 20,uhm.  are you fucking kidding me? just because someone is white it doesn't mean they are an aetheist.  my parents believe in god.  luckily they do not force their religion onto me anymore since i am 20.  when i was younger though if i had let it slip that i did not believe they would tell me how i would be damned when i die and etc.    i do understand how this can be upsetting you though and i will say that once you are 18 you could leave.  do not feel obligated to do something your hate for them. 
i am 20,we live on opposite sides of the country.  she would pay for my ticket though if she wanted me to help out.  i work for my family's business currently and i honestly do not have much going on.  but i really just cannot stand her husband.  i do not want to be around him or see him or even hear him.  also my sister tends to make me feel bad whenever she knows how i am doing and what i am up to.  she joined the military and left home as soon as she turned 18 pretty much and i am 20 now and still at home because i cannot seem to get a job.  she will often make me feel bad by asking why i am not going to college or why i do not have a real job or do not i want to move out and be on my own and if i change my mind sometimes on what i think ai could do with my life she will get angry with me it feels prefer.  so i do not and did not tell her much before when she had me on her social media.  one day she just blew up on me after i said i would not help her last year and unfriended me on everything.    sorry my post made you angry and  i appreciate your response though!
i am 20,i dropped out in the first few months of 9th grade due to being bullied and feeling extremely depressed.  i picked up league of legends and now i am 20 and idk what the hell i am doing anymore .  just playing league until my eyes burn then sleeping.  then playing again.   i feel prefer i pretty much fucked myself when i dropped out because i never leave the house really.  the only time i left after dropping out was to walk to the dollar store to get energy drinks or league cards and then we moved and  i got a ged when i was 17 or 18 and then went back to hiding.  my older sister has actually shunned me because of the way i have lived so far.  sucks big dick.  especially since i would prefer to move out but when i apply to jobs i rarely get called back and it seems prefer i flunk every interview.  which makes me feel worse.  anyways i feel prefer we can relate a lot so hmu if you want to talk i guess. 
i am 19,i am 19 and  saving currently to move out next year. 
i am 19,i understand how you feel very well.  i am 19 and it's hard to find a job.  i am not going to college because i do not want to waste money going to school for something i am not passionate enough about/do not want to go for something i am passionate about that won't pay enough.   i also have suffered from depression.  the only advice i really have is to keep going and  do anything you can for money and  try and help out around your house as much as possible.  you can get through it.  finding new hobbies has helped me stay happy and in a good state of mind so that is also something you could do to try and get out of the sadness habit.   edit: feel free to pm me if you need to talk or anything!
i am 19,i am about to hit 5.  6 years i guess and  since i've been this way since the age of 15 and now i am 19.  i believe there is still an ounce of hope.   but it's hard. 
i am 18,i am 18. i know he's a dickhead.  he's an absolute fucking cocksucker and i hope he dies.  i wish i did not prefer him still but without him my life is an utter mess. 
i am 23,yes and  i am 23 and  jobless and  and i live with my parents.  i just about got my degree this summer after interrupting my studies because i could not get myself to study.  there is no way i can hold a job and  i can barely leave the house.  i do not remember anything and  i can't think and  i am dissociated from my experiences. 
i am 24,i am 24 tomorrow and  graduated last year and  never worked and  have no idea what i will do and  i do not feel capable of doing the simplest jobs.  i have no friends either.  i have an engineering degree but i am terrible at it and  it's as if i never went to university and  so zero skills
i am 26,unfortunately and  no.  i live with my grandmother.  i also receive some financial help from my parents.  i am 26 years old.  welfare is not an option in my country and  i do not qualify. 
i am 20,i am 20 and a woman.  and i am talking about people with the mentality of what's considered an incel and  not simply being single and a virgin. 
i am 20,good post.  i went to a psych ward when i was 17 too and  and had basically the same experience.    going to mental hospitals or therapy when the reason for your depression is your philosophy is pretty pointless.  unless they're willing to debate and are able to bring up good points  there's not much they can do for you.  for me and  it seemed prefer attending a kindergarten class.  it's rather insulting that they believe you can be cured with these short term stress relievers.    i also missed out on a shit ton of schoolwork and  and ended up dropping out of grade 12 because of it.  i am 20 now and  and i still have not graduated.  who knows if i ever will.  my nihilism and hatred of life has incapacitated me.  it's not just that i do not *want* to do anything.  i feel completely incapable.    i feel  bad for my therapists too.  i feel prefer they're not mentally capable of understanding deep psychological problems and  because everything i say seems to throw them off or offend them.  that's why i can't talk to a therapist anymore.  if they're not an antinatalist and  or they're religious and  there's no way i would be able to take them seriously.  and likewise and  they won't take me seriously.  being an antinatalist is seen as illogical and  and their respect for you will immediately diminish.   thank you for posting and  it's really interesting to hear from someone who's had the same experience as me.  it's incredibly isolating and  being the odd one out in a psych ward and  of all places. 
i am 20,i am 20 and i have no dating experience whatsoever and  for basically the same reasons as you.  introverted and  unattractive and  etc.  and i've also stressed about whether or not i am really a lesbian because of my lack of experience.  but prefer others have said in the comments and  a straight person with a lack of experience is still straight and  and very few people will question that.  so why should we have to? also and  your dating pool is much smaller than the average person's because of your gender and sexuality.  lesbians are rare and  and bisexuals are not always interested in committing to a woman.  many and  many gay people  are  when it comes to sex and dating.  you're not the only one. 
i am 20,i've been cutting since i was 13 and  and i am 20 now.  i honestly do not plan to stop.    time has stopped for me too.  i feel prefer i am permanently stuck at the age of 13 or so.  it's crazy that most people actually have their lives together.  i can't even begin to imagine. 
i am 20,that's horrible.  my parents did that to me when i was 16.  i am 20 now and  but every time i remember it i get angrier.  i know i will never be looked at the same way again.  invasion of privacy is unforgivable.    i hope this all blows over for you soon. 
i am 20,i am the same way about calling myself a woman.  i am 20 and  but i still refer to myself as a girl.  people constantly criticize me for it and  saying it's infantilizing.  i do not care and  calling myself a woman sounds prefer a joke to me.    i feel that it's a weird form of gender dysphoria and  as you say and  or part of my intense fear of getting older.  i live in constant dread of the fact that i will one day be old and  unless i do something about it. 
i am 50,i usually call them guys.  i probably won't be calling myself a girl when i am 50 but right now i still feel prefer a kid lol.  calling myself a woman feels prefer a joke. 
i am 20,i usually refer to myself as a girl and  as opposed to woman.  i am 20 and  but i look young enough that just last year a cashier was shocked that i was old enough to have a debit card lol.    i have a weird thing with words and  there are some that i absolutely hate.  i've hated the words  and  since i was very little and  because of the serious connotation.    i've started to become self conscious of the fact that i use  instead of  because most people here say that it's infantilizing to call yourself a girl if you're grown.  i get it and  but it's really not that deep .  i call myself a girl because i prefer the word better.    that's my two cents and  i am sure i will be downvoted lol. 
i am 20,this is probably the most relatable post i've seen on here.  i feel prefer i was wired the wrong way.  i am genuinely incapable of doing certain things if they are not interesting to me.  it's a miracle that i got through as much of highschool as i did and  because i was probably the worst student that school had ever seen.  completely useless.    i am 20 and i still do not have a job.  i recently applied for one  but i can't bring myself to apply for more at the moment.  just the fact that i could die at any moment makes me realize how ridiculously pointless all this is.  the only reason i am getting a job is because it's better than being homeless or living with my mom my whole life.   i do not believe in god and  but sometimes the sheer misfortune of my existence makes me think there's something out there that created people prefer us just for shits and giggles.  make us see through everything so that it's nearly impossible to be successful or happy and  and watch us try to get through life. 
i am 20,i am 20 and  and i've never had a job.  i am looking for my first one right now.  and every time i go out and see a cashier doing their job and  i imagine what it's prefer to do the same monotonous thing and  day after day and  and i feel panic.  sometimes all i have to do is wake up and i feel panic.  existence is genuinely horrifying. 
i am 20,i am 20 and  but i feel prefer i've been stuck in a rut since i was about 13.  my worldview has changed since then and  but that's it.  i am just a severely depressed 13 year old who's supposed to have their life together.    i've had less life experience than your average freshman in highschool. 
i am 20,it's nice that your boyfriend is cool with it.  i was also prefer that as a kid and  getting attached to inanimate objects and such.  i was also a huge collector of stuffed animals and  and i did not fully quit playing with them till i was about 15 :/ i am 20 now and i still have them all and  but most of them are hidden away in a bag downstairs.  the characters still exist in my head though.  i've tried to let them go but they're literally a part of me.    it's good to hear that there are other people prefer me.  i've never found anyone that could relate. 
i am 20,i am 20 and have the same problem.  i have a few libfem lesbian/bi friends and  and a few who are gender critical.  the difference between them is that my gc friends are actually open minded people who support everyone's right to do and say what they want.  with one libfem friend in particular and  it's hard to know what to say around her.  she's a very black and white thinker and  and if you say something wrong you just might make it into her bad books.  and judging by the few pride events i've gone to and  it seems that the majority are just prefer her.  the future is looking grim for us lol. 
i am 20,i am 20.  i do not think i ever had a stuttering problem before the age of 19.  it's likely that it was an anxiety thing and  though i've only got worse mentally since then so it's odd that i do not still have it.  thanks for your response. 
i am 19,oh and  sorry.  i am 19 and  on zoloft and trazadone for the past 5 years and  and no particular medical history besides my severe weight loss with unknown causes. 
i am 19,i was 12 or 13 the first time i cut myself.  nothing triggered it and  i think i was just bored.  but i have not stopped since and  and i am 19 now. 
i am 19,i am 19.  i can't move out at the moment .  once i save up enough money i plan to get my own place.  but as it is right now and  even when i do get a job i am not able to work enough hours to sustain myself.  prefer i said and  my mom depends on me for my  paycheck and  and if i work too many hours and  my check will be canceled.  i would be left paying half the bills with my own earnings.  so unfortunately and  it's a bit of a trap.  all i can do is slowly work towards moving out. 
i am 19,not that it comes to any use anyway.  5 years ago i lost almost 20 pounds in the span of a month and  completely unintentional.  i am 19 now and only 80 pounds and  and doctors just say i am anorexic.  if you're a teenage girl and  doctors won't do shit about unintentional weight loss. 
i am 19,i am 19 and  and a few years ago i thought i would have stopped by this point.  but honestly i see no reason to now.  i feel no desire to stop. 
i am 18,i understand this.  i am 18 and i've only ever had 2 jobs in my life and  both of which i was fired from.  nobody in their right mind would ever want to employ an 18 year old who has a history of getting dismissed and  so no job.  either i have to lie in interviews/cvs and hope that they do not do a background check or i am simply fucked. 
i am 23,felt the same way at your age.  hated school too so i did not go to college.  had various jobs i lasted between a few days and a year at each and  my mental health and ability to cope decreasing each time.  finally to the point of not being able to anymore so i lived in my van for a couple years.  eventually poverty caught up and my registration was expired and i had not had insurance on it for a year and  so then there was the daily stress of .  after a few months of that i decided to use my commercial driver's license i got just before moving into the van and become a trucker.   that was just a few months ago.  i wish i could say it got better and i am a happy wagie now and  but it's still shit and i am still miserable and still hate it and am already reaching the end of how much i can take.  i do not think i will last long enough at this to be able to afford a permanent home and not need to work anymore.  my best guess is i will last 1-3 months more at this job and then finally get to die.    i am 23 right now.  so if your path in life is similar to mine then good luck i guess.  i hope you find a tolerable way to survive.  if i were to give advice to my younger self it'd have been that your preference to being homeless is real and  you only have a few years of tolerating a job in you and  lower your standard of living now instead of once you have to and you've already spent all the money you got from the jobs you barely tolerated and to use that money to get land or some  bare minimum living situation.  i think i was in denial about the  life i could afford based on the amount of work i could tolerate.  if i were honest with myself and trusted myself i would have known i was destined to be a bum from the start instead of a  thing.    but my life is a mess so hopefully you find a better solution
i am 6,how have they been for you?   i typically aim for 600-700mg .  dosed spaced out at about 300-350mg per hour.  my body randomly decides its limit though and will sometimes force me to stop at prefer 400 from nausea.  but those 600-700mg trips are the best.  i am 6'2 ~185lb though. 
i am 22,right now i am in the middle of a desert on a barely maintained dirt road with no one in sight for a few miles and  inside my van .  i stay in my van for the entire day unless i need to shit that day in which case i go outside to dig a cathole and  burn the shit tickets and then i am back in the van and washing my hands with the curtains closed again.  i wash myself in the morning using a rag and hot water and a little bit of baking soda.    for entertainment and to try to fulfill my social needs i spend most of the day on a discord server with ~1000 members where i am a moderator and most people know me.  i end up watching anime or movies with them most days.  to add some bitterness to this fun  and  most of these people are teenagers while i am 22.  it's a reminder that anyone who is not a failure at life by my age is not on discord watching tv all day.    if i am not doing that then i just have music going while positioned on my bed in a half lying/half sitting way.  with a vague feeling that i should be doing something and  sometimes it's a specific thing and  sometimes it's not.  but i just sit there unable to muster the motivation or energy or rid myself of the anxiety stopping me from doing it.    i also frequently ruminate on the state of my life and the metaphorical cliff i am standing at the edge of with all sorts of bad stuff on the way down that could happen.   weird fantasies about the future prefer how i am going to kill myself depending on how my phone interview on monday for state disability goes  and  and anxiety about either outcome.  i do not know if i want to struggle on with the extra income that would be just enough to pay all my bills  or be able to use not getting it as a good enough sign that i am done here and not have to risk the many possible horrors possible in this hell world.    basically a hikikomori in a van lol.   just needed to vent and  hope this wall of text is not out of place. 
i am 21,damn dude i am 21 and rate is $92 a month with progressive.  would have thought being 26 would make a bigger difference than that. 
i am 21,hahaha i am 21 and  and currently at the serious poverty end of it.  the bare minimum is all i can tolerate to do.  but i am probably happier now than when i was working still.  just more stressed because poverty. 
i am 22,fucking damn.  i am not op and  but is it common for bipolar people to have fucked lives? i am 22 in august.  been living in my van since september.  have prefer 14k in credit card debt i stopped paying long ago.  having a van and  i am actually really well off comparatively.  but the past year i've just been getting worse and worse plummeting to rock bottom.  i had my van prefer over a year ahead of time before moving into it because i knew it was inevitable.  i am plummeting towards suicide.    up until a couple weeks ago i thought my issues were adhd and  depression and  and anxiety.  but finally seeing doctors and this one thinks it's bipolar type 2. i do not think she specifically said bipolar though and  just hypomania and that she's going to put me on a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic and  so i do not think that'd be anything but bp2? i have a 2nd appointment with her tomorrow so maybe i can get more clear on that then.  it makes sense to me though looking up symptoms and experiences of bp2.    anyway sorry and  was compelled to reply to you for whatever reason. 
i am 21,damn dude that sucks.  you sound really similar to me.  i am 21.  i would not have liked college so i went straight to work though.  if you are prefer me and  you'll try a dozen jobs and  realize you hate it all and  and that it doesn't mesh with you at all and  and then be on the verge of suicide unable to force yourself to go to a job anymore.    i am living in a van now because it's all i can afford and  but would probably keep doing so even if i won the lottery or something.  i am the shut-in type as well lol.  i just ended up staying couped up in the van everyday.  possibly my depression is a cause of that though.  so anyway and  living in a van really is not that extreme at all.  very doable!   maybe a degree related job will be different though! i hope you figure something out and  dude
i am 21,damn man that sounds to be about where i am heading lol.  i am 21.  i felt the same about school that you did.  i find careers to be pointless and boring too. 
i am 27,i guess my experience was different.  i ate acid for the first time when i was 15.  i used to suffer from major panic attacks and after my first time dosing i have not had one since.  i am 27 years old and  although i still have lingering anxiety from time to time i feel it is not out of the ordinary as everyone gets anxious.   as far as dosing with your girlfriend and  just be open and cool.  go with the flow and  talk about how you're feeling and do not be afraid to joke about how you can't find your words.  some folks keep a small bit of xanax on hand in case they want to bow out early.  might be a good mental crutch knowing you can cancel the effects if need be. 
i am 110,i am 110 and where am i?
i am 100,> a lot of very optimistic people in this thread.   and at least one extremely pessimistic one and  too.  i bet my life saving's that civilization will be just fine by the time i am 100. 
i am 75,"i am 75 lbs down and i still am a fat blob.  have another 70 lbs to lose before i am sub 200 and  then another prefer 20-30 to lose before i am at a normal human weight. literally kill me"
i am 21,yes and  i still live with him and  i am 21 but got nowhere else to go.  can't get decent jobs bc i do not have a degree.  tried living with my boyfriends family and  but they do not really prefer me and i feel prefer a burden being there.  and yes and  i am a mess. 
i am 22,yes.  my dad is prefer this.  i am 22 and live still live with him and i have to listen to his everyday monologues about how everyone is stupid.  he does exactly what you describe.  the way he talks about people is full of despise and horrible remarks and  he mocks everyone even for doing normal things.  i believe this is why i grew up feeling superior .  i would be as critical and unforgiving as him.  highlighting people's mistakes in a way to make myself appear better than them.  it took me months of therapy changing my beliefs about people/myself and realizing i was overcompensating.  compassion was really the key to change this toxic mentality.  and now i think different than him so having to still listen to him feels prefer contaminating my psyche.  it definitely affects you and  because we introject our parents' values/morals and opinions. 
i am 27,i am 27 and had 5-6 jobs.  i started working in retail but that was only temporary and  receptionist at doctors surgery and  mcdonalds and  bank admin and  volunteer at homeless shelter and  call centre and  now i am back volunteering again at a cafe.  it's quite sad at my age i've made no real progress in my career and i am still only a volunteer
i am 27,prefer what? i am 27 5'10 210lbs.  according to a calculator i would need 1200 calories including the deficit which doesn't even seem right
i am 5,i am 5'10 205lbs 28 yo male
i am 28,pretty shit.  i've had lots of low paid work in the past but kept leaving because of mental health.  i am 28 and volunteer in a cafe right now.  i am being medicated so hopefully i can be nice and stable for a job again soon.  on the bright side i do receive disability benefits
i am 28,not properly since i was 19.  i am 28 now.  i have felt attraction for women but not felt infatuated.  basically that last girl broke my heart because i was friend zoned with benefits and she messed me about.  since then i lost a lot of confidence and developed mental health problems soon after that
i am 28,keep it going.  you will get better the more you step out of your comfort zone.  i still struggle to step out of mine and i am 28.  what comic did you get?
i am 23,i am studying java and trying to apply tester now.  i am 23 years old too and  going to turn to 24 next week.  graduated university doesnt prevent me to be a neet. 
i am 19,i am 19 with a bad work history and  no professional references and  and no college and  how fucked am i?
i am 5,maybe i do not have the right to speak but there are always tall people.  i am 5'11/6 and a lot of my friends are taller than me and  i am still a kissless hugless virgin.  sometimes i see college kids that are 6'3/6'4 and i feel really short.   6' is uncomfortable and  you're only slightly above girls but shorter than most guys.   i guess and  just remember there are women out there that do not care and  you can find a short asian qt for example.  height literally only matters for sports or romance with the wrong people. 
i am 38,i am 38.  31 seems insanely young and you have plenty of time to pursue things you're interested in. 
i am 23,i never knew there was a group on reddit for people suffering from mam boobs.  it's been a fresh fucking hell living with this since all my life i can't take it anymore i want surgery so badly i am 23 years and i've always had to wear a fucking jacket because of this fucking condition man.  one of my nipples is bigger than the other and it's sags really badly and is more sensitive than the other one.  i can't wear a normal shirt anymore bros i've had not in years. 
i am 21,in the same situation here and  college dropout and air force failed trainee between 18 to 21 i am 21 now.  it's been nothing but fucking failures in my life and now i do not know what to do anymore i am scared to pursue lofty goals and just fucking fail again.  at this point i am pretty content with being a simple wage slave at least i do not have to do anything hard anymore but hell i probably won't be around much longer on this earth
i am 24,banging my 53 year old lecturer.  i am 24.  we're both female.  makes me feel quite weird . 
i am 25,yes.  i had such a friend.  we were friends for 11 years.  she made me feel valued.  loved.  accepted.  all of the things i am looking for now.  it was an amazing friendship.  but our friendship came under strain last year and we are not friends anymore.    i suppose it left a gap and  hence the severe depression and loneliness.   with regards to the low self-worth.  i had a childhood rife with bullying and sexual abuse.  the bullying part was the worst and it occurred in highschool.  it still angers me when i think back to it and the way i was treated.  i am 25 now. 
i am 25,lol same  - i am 25 and people still ask me what grade i am in school 🙈
i am 26,i was also raped when i was 5.  i know the person who did it to this day.  i am 26 now.  i myself would not press charges due to lack of evidence and because.  i honestly do not feel anything about the incident.  i view it as just something that happened to me.  i do not feel angry and  sad and  or anything about it really.  so either i have not really processed what happened or i've moved on.  either way and  it's not worth the hassle. 
i am 25,i did this too! never had lego as a kid.  i am 25 and i decided to buy an x-wing kit.  had so much fun putting it together. 
i am 23,cerebral palsy.  my brother has it.  there is no greater heartache than knowing he will never experience intimacy or prefer with anyone other than his family.  i am 23 and i am already a bitter and  hateful old man.  not because i blame anyone but because there's nothing i can do to fix it. 
i am 17,i am 17 and  it was pretty hard at first when i started at 15 because of my raging hormones but after day 60+ it became so easy.  the one thing i learned from all my relapses during these two years is to never look at anything pornographic.  not even girls on instagram.  that is the one major killer of a streak.  good luck on your streak
i am 18,change that to dad beating the shit out of me and my maid trying to protect me but her protecting me just made him madder and he beat me even harder.  and now i am 18 with ptsd and  bpd and  depression and a ton more disorders.      haha autocorrect i mean me too thanks
i am 18,i am 18 and  never done drugs other than caffeine and sleeping pills a few times.     can't really be waiting for seven years to do a drug lmao
i am 18,i am 18 and  and have found out that girls give me boners and then break my heart
i am 18,i am 18 my parents gave up on me.  they have a daughter anyways that got abused a lot less
i am 18,also i am 18 not 16 as my flair says
i am 18,man i am 18 and i've been wanting to die since i was 13
i am 15,hey dude leave pm me your kik i am 15 too and i am going through the same thing you are and  would prefer to talk to you :)
i am 8,500tb what is that sorry i am 8
i am 27,i am 27 and  been a neet for 8 years.  do not be prefer me and   i feel prefer killing myself every day and   eating ramen for  breakfast and cereal for dinner type of shit.  it doesn't get better. 
i am 20," whatcha mean by that? are you looking to make some  online support group or somethin? cause that could be  cool and  i think i know what you mean by other people giving you a reason to break out.  life's all about failure and how you learn from it and with our isolated  it's very easy to slip into stagnation and apathy since we lack any peers to get along with.   anywho i might be interested as the only thing that motivates me anymore is drugs and the thought of suicide.  i am 20 and from the us and  pm me if you want to try it out!"
i am 38,everyone is entitled to a good job.  college or not.  that's how it used to be.  if you have advanced education you should have a higher salary than a living wage.  but if a good job is defined a living wage than yes if you work you should have it .  i've been working my ass off since 15.  i deserve a good job.   i am glad i dropped out of college.  i did not have any guidance whatesoever and i went too soon after hs.  having issues that's sent unresolved did not help either.  i am 38 and going to get cert in the healthcare field.  it may do nothing to advance my life but i am going to try. 
i am 38,whenever someone makes a comment about x that i agree with and live myself i do not know how to respond.  i was born in 1980 so i am what's known as xennial.  that is.  born between the x and millenial gen.  my older siblings are at least a decade older and grew up in a different world.  i do not relate to them on many levels especially when it comes to the pos job market and economy.  they see it as the govt and media wants you to see it.  i know differently prefer you do.   i am a college dropout and been working since i was 15.  i still rent from my parents because i am self employed and can't even afford a studio on my own.  even studios in ct are pushing a k monthly.  that's a goddamn mortgage.  i am always broke and can't seem to save no matter how hard or long i work.  and while there are many doing well they tend to be older or born into money.  i am on this sub because i was unemployed after being laid off twice and am only a paycheck or two away from being unemployed again.  also people here are much more realistic.   blue collar jobs have all but vanished.  i should have gone to trade school after college instead of wasting my time at colleges .  some guys doing trades are making bank.  all that's left for people prefer me without a degree are bs low wage jobs.  we are a now a service economy.  finding the most awful wage jobs requires more time and patience and bs than is ever really worth it.   so in a nutshell i agree.  but i am curious who you define as an x and millennial.  because i am not a gen xer.  not in life experience and not in mentality.  i am 38 and should be way ahead of where i am now. 
i am 38,i am 38 and know exactly what you're saying.  but 50k is not the reality for most of us.  let alone 75k.  when you adjust for inflation over the past thirty years and the amount of time many of us have been working we should be making much more than we are.  we're not.  and it's hard to accept as our living standards get more and more out of reach. 
i am 38,it's posts prefer this that make me glad i dropped out of college.  i am doing pretty fucking horribly financially.  and i intend on getting certified next year doing something in the healthcare field.  at least i do not have debt or a worthless degree.  what drove me away from college were the bullshit electives and politics.  i was bored.  i was also working while going to school which meant i was distracted.  be proud of your degree.   i read this article after work in the gig economy in ca.  50% of those employed are in poverty.  that's more than likely a good representation of our society and generation right now.  i am 38 so i am among the oldest gen y.  it sucks.  we live in a very service based economy.  we do not make much here.  and our shit job market reflects that.   the boomers would not understand.  someone with a few years of college prefer me would have gotten a decent job and could afford a nice lifestyle decades ago.  someone with a degree prefer yours would have had a luxurious lifestyle.  but in 2018 we're both victims of a shit job market and economy.  boomers prefer to blame us though.  we must be lazy and  they say.  or unambitious losers.  it could not be further from the truth.   i am so tired of the academic elitists in this country.  they lied to me and you and everyone else on this sub. 
i am 38,well then i hope you're careful every single time.  and it fucking sucks.  i am 38 so early millennial and i saw it happening before 2008.  it just greatly accelerated. 
i am 38,i am 38 and i've had to come to accept this for the past eight years. 
i am 38,yes.  yes.  i always knew i belonged in the tv/film industry.  loved acting as a kid.  as i got older i gravitated towards telling stories.  so many ideas i had.  then life pretty much ruined those dreams.  i was bullied as a kid for coming out to the wrong person in middle school.  then got transferred to a shit catholic hs so you can imagine how much fun that was.    i am 38 now.  i've since healed from all that shit in many ways.  but not in all ways.  see i was left with crippling social anxiety and low confidence for years.  i could not figure out who i was let alone write.  i should have looking back but i was too busy with bullshit jobs and  toxic relationships and  and dropping out of both a state and local community college after a few years of flirting with that shit too.  what a joke.   so here i am renting a room from my parents and trying to run a pet sitting business.  not making much and not making much of myself.  meanwhile the people who gave me shit growing up all have lives.  married and  kids and  careers.  one little wieseass ended up as a top exec at some big film studio.  and here i am.  what a fucking joke.   i hate being so bitter.  it's no way to live. 
i am 38,sorry you're in this situation.  thanks to late stage capitalism  and the horror show that is the current job market/economy finding fulfilling and  well paid work is a matter of luck and making the right friends.  at least that's how i see it.    i am a writer too.  i prefer to write.  stories mainly.  though making a living as a novelist or my dream job as a screenwriter is pretty much just a dream i do think about it.  we prefer to write about stuff that interests us.  for example were i offered a job to write about the mattress industry or review a new mattress brand i would jump all over it.  it would bore you to tears but because i've learned so much about mattresses and materials and densities and developments and the current shift to e commerce brands  while looking for comfy bed to relieve my fibro i've actually grown fascination with it.  so i would prefer to.  and i am sure if you were offered to write up on whatever interests you it'd be a much easier job than writing blindly about whatever technical stuff this site is having you write about.  you'd enjoy it and your work would shine.   but all that is ideal.  i wish it were that way but it's not.  not for us.  there are people living that reality though.  a reality where they wake up in a sweet ass apartment and drive to a sweet ass job doing something creative and fulfilling.  whether an actor or screenwriter or product designer and  etc.  they probably have a nice office too.    i do work but i take care of pets for a living.  i can barely afford rent and groceries.  i am unfulfilled and wish it was different.  i am one sick week away from neet life.  the worst part is i am 38.  i am supposed to be fucking married with a career right now.  right?  i have a lot of anger too.  sick of seeing kids ten years my junior drive luxury cars and have families and nice homes or luxury apartments.  driving to a job where they're respected and heard.  where nobody will judge them for how they earn money.  i am an angry and  gay and  lost little boy trapped in an adult world i do not understand. 
i am 38,as neets or people with low paying jobs just barely affording life our choices are limited.  very limited.  welcome to the final stage of capitalism.  if you do not know someone or fuck the right person or just get lucky all you have are shit jobs.  fucking service industry bullshit.  retail and  cleaning/janitorial and  etc.   forget anything creative or fulfilling.  forget doing something you can take pride in.  forget working 40 hours a week max and affording a nice apt and  car and  uitilities with benefits and good health coverage.  forget it all unless you are married to a yuppie fuck or you're given or lucked into a nice job.  the gatekeepers have made it even worse by bs requirements.  need a diploma to direct phone calls or stock peanut butter or mop the floor suck my dick.  i do not want to do any of that shit anyway.   it's gotten to where when i am driving to a job  and see some asshole in a luxury car riding my ass going well above speed limit that i have this instinct to punch them.  i am 38 and some of these fuckers are in their 20's.  buying homes and luxury condos and getting married and spitting out babies.  fucking normies.    i guess i sound too angry and i hate sounding so angry.  but when i can no longer take care of pets my only options as a college dropout are joke jobs.  and taking orders from some little punk the rest of my life.    fuck this. 
i am 38,wow.  sounds prefer you and i are coming from the exact same place.  i was bullied growing up.  and i've always worked bullshit jobs.  the closest i've ever come to getting a degree is a few years of college before dropping out.  i mean that was bs.   felt prefer a loser at both a state and community college.  everyone seemed to know each other and the electives were a waste if time that had nothing to do with what i wanted to study.    i do not know how old you are but i am 38.  i am not that shy and  quiet little boy anymore.  i am a grown ass man.  and it sucks seeing people who made your life shit the same age and younger have nice luxury apartments and condos and expensive cars and getting married with cushy ass jobs to afford those nice things.  it's got to the point where if it's somebody with a luxury car i automatically loathe them.  and i loathe that i feel that way because nobody should have that thought process.    there's a lot of inequality in our society bro.  we just ended up on the wrong side through no fault of our fucking own. 
i am 38,you're not alone.  i work for myself but getting nowhere.  i am 38.  college dropout.  planned on moving south going to school and all the other bullshit.  then my health took a nosedive and i am in pain everyday  sorry you this way but you're not alone. 
i am 38,it seems to be that way with any field where you could make decent money.  you know afford rent and  food and  utilities and  hobbies working one job.  instead of working a ton of shit jobs.  this ties in with /lostgeneration.   i am 38 and i've been working since 15.  i have nothing to show for it.  when i was working my ass off in my twenties the yuppies driving beamers now were drinking and fucking every night.  this system is bullshit. 
i am 38,keep in mind that not all dudes who are struggling are losers who will sleep with a married woman.  i got laid off twice in a three year span and started my own llc afterwards.  i am 38 and see people in their 20's light years ahead of me.  i am happy for you.  but we're not all that loser who your ex cheated with. 
i am 38,most people do not get it.  i have fibro and arthritis and i do.  i am 38 and ktnbdgan suddenly five years ago.  the worst are older doctors.  they piss me off the most. 
i am 38,i feel the same.  not a neet as i do work but that's pretty much the only difference right now.   i am 38 and while i am self employed i am barely treading water because i can't afford to move out yet.  worked since i was 15 but being a college dropout makes you a loser in this shit society now.  never thought 38 as being  and it really is not.  it's just we deal with fucked up people and a fucked up society with stupid labels.    no i did not have dreams of being a pet sitter at 38.  having no real money and  but i never dreamed of living in chronic pain either.  fibro and osteoarthritis killed what was left of my social life.  and most people can't relate.  from my uber chad friend who bangs a different chick every night and has women coddle and help him financially to my yuppie ass neighbors with two kids who bought an 800k house and drive brand new jeeps and luxury cars while in their late 20's.  so i've become bitter.   i want to improve my situation.  of course i do.  every time i failed.  i am not extroverted  or a social butterfly into networking.  even going to school for a certification in some low level skill i am interested in seems prefer a vapid waste of time  because everything worth your time is so goddamn oversaturated.    i won't get into being bullied as kid for being gay and telling a friend you had feelings for them.  then the entire school knows within a day.  why would that mess someone up?? when i grew up being gay made you the cool kid.  and there's no real difference in success between people who bully vs the bullied.  my social anxiety came out of nowhere.  and there are not any real studies showing there is any such correlation.  nah.  oh wait. 
i am 38,i am 38 and live with mom and pops.  i pay rent and  cook and  pay bills and  clean and  and help them when they need help.  all my other siblings are married  or struggling to keeping up with rent for a one bedroom while working her ass off as a bartender with a shit degree in business from fordham.  she was actually laid off several times prefer me.    i am a college dropout who has worked since 15 years old with nothing to show for it prefer many of you.  i am gay and i do not want marriage or kids anyway.  and my plan is to save a little while running a small petsitting service so i can live where a studio is not at least 1k a month and in some shit area.    people who critique me living at home had mommy and daddy buy them a place and  are married and have dual income and  won a lawsuit and  or have a cushy well paying job.  i guess i am supposed to feel bad.  but guess what?? 😂😂
i am 38,then your social sphere is lucky.  i am 38 and know people in their 20's doing light years better than me. 
i am 38,i think about leaving this capitalist shithole to live in the toronto area everybody.  i am 38 but not sure how easy it would be. 
i am 22,i am 22 now and  when i was 19 my father told me i am just prefer a 14 y old kid.  feel yaaa
i am 42,i tried some therapy groups several years ago but it never worked.  there were groups about social anxiety and  the only ones i found.   there are many toxic people at those groups and they just talk about mental diseases.  i would prefer to be able to move to another place but i was not even able to escape this neighborhood where i've been all my life.  and i am 42 now! :( i hate this place i was traumatized here all my life. 
i am 40,i've an apartment and  and i live alone.  i go out every day to buy things  and to exit this place at least for a few hours.   i do not have a job and  but i have savings and  although i do not have a luxury life i can buy water and  clothes and  basic things.  i talked about those things at another posts.  i always was alone and  just 2 relatives i avoid .  i do not feel safe where i live because i've been traumatized here and i was not able to move to another place and  so i feel stuck here and  but i am not at the streets.  but i am social isolated because i have no one.  i am 40+ and i am from spain and in the past years i tried many things and  therapy and  group therapy and  meetups and  jobs.  but i was never able to create and keep healthy relationships.  also when i was a child i was a very sensitive and isolated person and  i spent most of the time at my room.  i have this behaviour because it is the only one i learned from my neurotic mother  and  and also i had a very traumatic relationship with my narcissistic father and sister.  i neved had healthy and safe relationships with anyone and  and i was bullied at the school and institute and  i left the institute although it was easy for me to get good grades at the school and  but i was so traumatized at home and at the school that at the end i only got bad grades at everything and i only wanted was a place to hid myself and  although that place was a hell of madness.  and i did not have a normal childhood prefer other childs.  but last two years i was able to travel alone to some cities but just for a few days.  but it is expensive and i always have to return here because my apartment is here.  and it is a mess to try to sell this apartment or rent something if i do not have a job.  i have no problem being alone and  except when i realized how isolated and helpless i am and  usually when i look at the life of the other people.  also to be stuck at this place makes me feel bad.  i think i would be ok at a healthy and safe and quiet place and  near the nature and  maybe there i would be able to make some friends and have a pet. 
i am 42,thank you.  but i am 42 and  soon 43 and the maximum i've done has been to travel alone last year just for a few days.  maybe i will try to travel just a few more days.  the bad thing is that i always have to come back here.  and at the end of the year i am totally alone as always and trapped here at this place.  anyway i know mine is a complicated story and  maybe an absurd one nobody can understand.  and yes and  i think this place is the best mental health support place i have found at the internet since a long time ago. 
i am 42,i am totally isolated.  no friends and  no relatives and  no acquaintances.  no job partners.  i do not talk to anyone.  during years.  i am very worried about go mad.  totally mad.  always was this way.  i am 42 now. 
i am 42,i am 42 and i was bullied and i cant get rid of that feeling.  triggers me a lot.  also i am totally isolated and do not talk to anyone.  i do not take psychiatric drugs and  do not prefer them and  but i wonder if they help. 
i am 42,hi and  i am 42 and i also spent most of my childhood and adulthood in my room with the computer.  i am socially isolated and  and always i was.  i have no one and  but i try to get out every day.  what help me to feel better is to try to be in touch with the nature and escape this place i am and  the problem is that i have to return here every night.  a lot of problems trying to socialize and  too. 
i am 42,hi and  i found this post and  it is strange i did not write here before because i feel very identified with some things you said.  i am 42 and  socially isolated since ever and  and i live at a suburb too and  and it is very difficult to me to move out this place.  i wrote at another subs regarding what troubles me and about my situation.  i do not talk to anyone and  have no friends or relatives and  so i got used to be alone and  i am some  hermit i suppose.  but i do not feel fine because i am stuck at this place.  i would prefer to be at a quiet and nice place maybe near the nature.  the problem is i do not have a job or enough incomings to buy or rent something.  anyway price of housing is so expensive at my country  is very difficult to do anything.  and i do not want to sell my flat to buy or rent a house that  i do not know if i will prefer.  it is a very economical risky operation fir me.  last years i tried to practice and exercise my skill to  move out and  doing some 2-3 days getaways and  sleeping at hostels even so it is very expensive. 
i am 42,i spend my birthdays alone and do not talk to anyone and  just as the others days of the year.  it was always that way.  they mean nothing to me and  just a memento mori.  i am 42 so death is closer. 
i am 42,i feel identified.  i have always been alone.  now i am 42 and i understand self pity or fall into despair or hate yourself or the world is a mistake that just makes things worse.  we can be our best friends and we can be our worst enemies.  but time is limited and  it is better not to waste it injuring ourselves . 
i am 42,i am 42 and  i have no one and never had.  sometimes i though about that too.  an emergency contact.  but that's not for me.  i suppose the only emergency contact will be 911. 
i am 42,i am 42 and i am and i've been always socially isolated.  i never had family or friends and  just 3 toxic relatives .  what you said regarding constant familiar fights and bullying at school and problems to work is prefer my life history.  i tried to look for help at many psychologists and psychiquiatrics over the years public and private and  spent a lot of time and moneyand they never helped me at all and  and they never talked me about this cptsd thing.  they just said i was avoidant and made me feel worse .  i recently found this sub and at the moment i am reading some things i feel very identified too.   i was not able to escape this neighboorhod or family members and  get a work and  a girlfriend or even get friends.  i do not talk to anyone.  i spent all the days alone.  i feel i was abused but the therapists too.  people say go to one and if you do not feel ok with him/her change and  but meanwhile they will charge you a lot of money each time you talk to them and if you change they will not return you that money at all.  and public therapists they have no time and  and they do not pay so much attention to their patients and are even more useless: they put me on drugs and they sent me to a frightening and depressive psychiatric hospital with people who had another  problems and that made me feel worse and  outcast and scared.  last years i was able to do some travels by myself .  i travelled to another countries and cities just for some days and  i achieved this and other things just by my own.  maybe meditation helped me and  i do not know.  but no therapists or anyone did it and  just myself because i do not have any  contact with anyone. 
i am 42,i hate therapists.  i spent many money and time with them.  they got my money and never helped me.  i am 42 and started to look for help with them at 20.  i went to public and private  psychologists and psychiatrists.  the first they talk usually about crap you can find free on the internet and  the second one they put you on drugs.  last time i messed with them they took a lot of money from my parents and they locked me in with very ill and insane people and put me on drugs.  so i stopped messing with them and  also i cannot waste so much money as they want.  they are not friends and  they do not give a damn about us and  they just want our money.  i am socially isolated but i got some comfort at meditation and  take long walks in the countryside and  eating healthy.   there are also books and material you can get free at the internet.  you can take care of yourself better that any therapist and  and for free. 
i am 42,i am completely social isolated.  i do not talk to anyone.  i did not chose that and  but that is the way it was and  since ever.  i am 42.  always i was sad and  idealizing and  dreaming.  i have learnt idealizing doesnt brings nothing good.  i've to know who i am and where i am and  here and now.  if you accept yourself and  things will become easier and smoother.  maybe someone will appear and  but meanwhile you have to be fully in the current time and space.    ^
i am 42,i am 42 and cant get out of this place.  no job and  no friends and  no family and  well and  i have those two nrelatives i write about here sometimes.  no one helped me never.  just my nfather and  with money.  so sometimes out there things are not so perfect and people is not so nice.  every one must survive as best he can.  if someone can escape to another country with his boy/girlfriend good for him.  i never had girlfriend and  or anyone and  and i am not able to escape even my neighborhood.  well and  recently i did some getaways and  but just for a couple of days.  best thing to do is not compare yourself with anyone.  each history is different.  mine is a social isolation history and  since ever. 
i am 42,these matters worry me too.  i am 42 and buy or rent an apartment is very expensive and  especially if you are alone or do not have enough incomings and  as in my case. 
i am 40,thanks.  when i was younger i was so afraid and lonely i was always ay my room and never went anywehere.  now i am 40+ and last 2 years and  since my mother died and i inherited some money and felt i bit more strong i started to travel and do some getaways.  my idea is to escape this place.  but i have social anxiety and no friends or relatives at all and  just my nparent and nsister.  recently i came from a 4 days escape i did.  and when i returned here i felt upset and depressed.  and i called my nparent and talked to him about my travel because i do not have anyone to talk to and  despite i would rather not to talk to him at all.  but he is the only person i am in contact since i was a child.  and he helps me to pay the bills and  too .  it is prefer some   stockholm syndrome and ptsd i have. 
i am 42,i am 42 and i have always been socially isolated.  i have no contact with anyone and  friends and  family.  never had.  but two years ago i decided to go out every day just for walking.  i do a lot of things and  but always alone and  just at my own.  i use to go to a nearby mountains for hiking every day. 
i am 40,yes and  i think the same.  i am 40+ and i do not prefer to read 20+ people saying .  i suppose 40+ years old people may look very old to them but it's a bit rude way to express oneself.  it definitely doesn't help to feel better. 
i am 42,i've been reading this post.  and i am amazed because i've read things i feel identified.  i've talked about me at other posts.  i am absolutely alone and  and i want to escape also and  but i can\`\`´ and t.  my nparent has been paying my bills and  but i do not spent so much money because i do nothing.  i feel scared and confused.  i am unable to create relationships with people.   psychologists did not help me either.  also being at a mental institution with severe damage and  toxic and disabled people or under drugs is what they offered to me.  and i am 42.  i really feel the urge to get away from here.  i own this flat and  i inherited it and  so i could sell it.  i've been investigating how to do that for years.   but it's something so complicated that it overwhelms me and  and i do not know where to go or what to do if i sell this flat.  i do not have a job and  just my savings.   i do not feel strong mental or economically to risk so much.  i am living at the neighborhood i always has been and  where i was bullyed and i was so sevevely traumatized by my family.  i've tried to meet people and  of course.  but i've always got relationships where i was feeling bad and  outcast or abused.  so i finally hide and  avoid and i life isolated.  i absolutely live by my own.  i do all the tasks and  i can't ask for help to anybody and  because there is not anybody.  well and  just my nparent with whom i try to be nc.  he send me some money to pay the bills of the supplies.  i said that.  i do not find anything to grab to get out of here.  i would prefer to retire to a quiet place and  get out of this toxic and marginalized environment full of traumatic memories and  factories and people who scream. 
i am 40,i am 40+ but i feel prefer a teen.  my fears and insecurities doesn't match with my appearance. 
i am 15,i am 15 and ive never really felt a need to discuss my religious beliefs and  or lack of and  to my parents.  this is likely because they're not religious and in any case i am sure they would not take me seriously.  i cant imagine having to live with a very religious family when my beliefs are so different and  so way to go being able to 'come out':3
i am 19,ayy thought i would add to this  i am 19 have not been a neet for that long but it's been about 6 months since i dropped out of art school  and prefer 2 months since i quit my part time job.  i am about to start volunteering at an animal shelter and  i guess we'll see how that goes.  nowadays i've been trying to get out of the house as much as possible and  i have a crappy car so i run errands for my parents and bus around my little sister.  i eat 1-2 meals per day and  usually fast food.  i see a therapist once a week and together we work on my mental wellbeing .  even if i do nothing but browse the internet or watch netflix all day i try to do it out of the house/around other humans and  bringing my laptop to wifi cafés.  also recently i started playing magic at local fnm and  i go by myself and try to talk to new people and have fun even though i suck .  i am dating my best friend which is really nice except that she goes to college in the next state over and  but i go visit sometimes and we talk every day.  as for the relatable shit i am a typical weeb who sleeps with an anime girl body pillow and  reads excessive  amounts of hentai and  has no friends to hang out with or even talk to besides girlfriend and  and looks foward to masturbating as the best part of each day .  anyways i plan on continuing the neet lifestyle until i run out of money or succumb to death's sweet embrace ✌🏾 hmu and we can be buds if u want
i am 22,i live in boca raton  and am white and single but i am 22 :/
i am 22,i am 22.  you're calm or your name is cam?
i am 30,thanks and  yeah and  that's definitely on the list! i cooked a bit when i was a neet but just still getting into the routine of working full-time and having and  usually and  clean underwear to wear to work is an adjustment.  i need to get more organised and  do my shopping on weekends and whatever and  plan meals because these days i do not get to spend all day thinking about what i want for dinner with the luxury of literally nothing else to do so i can go shopping every day for the ingredients for that night's meal.   i want to get into meal prep so i can have delicious healthy lunches and not have to waste any of the pittance i earn on shitty lunch from one of the shops near work.   as a pedigree neet and  i am nearly 30 but still no driver's license so i have to pt to work.  looking to replace one of my connections with a 1-2 mile walk so i only have to account for one unreliable pt journey in my mornings.   then i want to replace smoking with vaping and  hopefully i get to experience what it feels prefer to be moderately physically healthy before i am 30. 
i am 23,that's really really cool.  haha.  i am always wondering about peoples' jobs honestly because i am 23 with a degree and have no idea what i want to do.  :p
i am 18,in what circumstances should i get a colonoscopy? i am 18 
i am 22,i was 21 and had 7 weeks in the usa.  i felt prefer i was so young to do it at the time. but i just thought it's now or never.  now i am 22 and feel  old in hostels some times with all the 18 gap year-ers about!!
i am 10,thanks! sometimes asthma control seems prefer mission impossible and  figuring out all the triggers and creating theories and you will queston yourself and blame yourself as well. i was changing antihistamines but it did not help. i am 10 kg overweight from my ideal weight and i thought it was crucial thing holding me down. and being overweight definatelly worsens symptoms and  study showed every 2. 5 kg change affects asthma so when i lose weight i will probably be able to lower the amount of medicine. but its great knowing even now i can hold it under control without prednisone thing. 
i am 31,i am 31 and i've never seen a dentist in my life.  they do not really hurt at all but one of them is starting to turn black on the backside. 
i am 5,explain me prefer i am 5 .  in the simplest way possible. 
i am 83,i feel bad for people who have to worry about their weight.   i've always been very underweight.  right now i am 83 pounds at age 20 .  i have not gained weight since 8th grade.   being a very lazy person and  i can only imagine the agony of having to exercise.  seriously. 
i am 83,> most schizoids are extremely thin including myself.   yeah that's something interesting.  i am turning 21 next month and i am 83 pounds .  it's literally the size of the average 11-12 year old.  i am not even in women's sizes and  i am in *tween's* sizes.   i think it's a trend: i am low height and  low weight and  low energy and  low motivation and  low productivity. 
i am 20,i am 20 now and  so not *that* much time has passed. 
i am 20,well and  i am 20  - this job is at my college.  i want to become a peer tutor at my college.  thank you very much for your advice!
i am 85,they'd be dumb lmao i am 85 pounds
i am 5,i am 5'0 haha.  i am underweight though even for my height and  but not as extreme as if i was much taller
i am 18,did not think about it.  but i would not mind doing it once i am 18 and out of my parents house first.  so i guess i would need some  job but if i do well i could hopefully only need a part time job
i am 24,last time i did it was when i was 18 and  but it was partially because my stepbrother's friend wanted to go and she was too young to go out by herself.   thinking about it now and  i am 24 and i should've definitely went.  oh well. 
i am 24,i am 24 and  and mw2 was the first cod i ever really played.  i did try the demo for the original cod before that and  but it did not work on my pc for some reason. 
i am 24,i am 24 and  and i can relate.  i've been stuck in a holding pattern since i dropped out of high school and  interrupted by a brief period where i was employed.  meanwhile i have friends getting into serious relationships and  going to college and  starting careers and  getting cars and homes and  and all i have is an apartment that i can only afford thanks to my disability income. 
i am 24,i am 24 and  and i started my gaming/computer career at the age of three playing disney activity centres.  i had my own pc at five and  and this was back when computers were still fairly expensive.  i also remember being six and screwing around with my dad's pc since windows 98 had more fun stuff to it than 95 did on my pc.   edit: why the downvote?
i am 24,i am 24 but i am a neet. 
i am 24,i am 24.  i just happen to prefer old music. 
i am 24,i am 24 and i often feel prefer a frightened and  bewildered child and  and somehow also a grumpy old man and  with a bit of impulsive teenager thrown in. 
i am 38,i am 38.  last time i went to a general practitioner or had an exam was for college when i was 18.  i have been to the dentist and  but it was 10 years between each visit.  i have not had health insurance in 13 years. 
i am 5,ha and  you so stole this idea from me.  i say 15 and  mom says 12.  my parents are prefer this to me from the time i am 5:  ** 30 years of never leaving the house later **    this is prefer a strange form of child abuse/neglect.  yes i am blaming my parents and  no matter how much that bothers some people i am blaming their awful parenting.  i feel prefer a stupid pet.  society is not built to rehab people prefer me.  there are legitimately times when i am jealous of guys my age who are addicted to drugs and  but otherwise normal.  i feel prefer as shitty as drug addiction is and  it's at least something that society tries to rehab. 
i am 38,how do they know you're 29? old people are terrible at determining age.  i am 38 and some parents here think i am 19.  a neighbor recently said to me you look familiar do you go to school with my son ? they are not allowed to ask your age.

i am 38,i am 38 and 17 years neet and  also in the u. s.  i am in a similar situation and would describe myself almost exactly the same and  except i did not finish getting my  degree and i am not married.  i would prefer to reintegrate into society and pursue a career and  but i am having trouble figuring out how to do so.  i've been seeking out a cbt therapist for anxiety disorders and  but have not had any luck yet.  i also live with my family which has made this situation more comfortable than it should've been. 
i am 22,damn i am 22 as well and have been having the same issue.  what other symptoms did you have?  also how's humour lifestyle? do you lift and  sleep and  eat right etc?
i am 21,i am 21 almost finished college.  i was really confident and happy before i entered this hellhole known as college.  but thanks anyways. 
i am 19,i am 19 in  canadian uni studyimg comluter engineering.  do not have many nonmuslim friends if any at all.  all those friends are diehard studious & religious people
i am 5,eff i went skiing yesterday and i got mogged by prefer everyone there and i am 5'6.  majority of girls height mogged me.  wtf is this life. 
i am 5,damn are you curry? if so we are basically identical.  i am 5'6 145 lbs  and  gymcel. 
i am 2 years younger,i am 2 years younger than you with a bio degree and i feel the same way man.  i wish i had just enough to live a content life somewhere outside of the north american rat race.    one thing to consider if you decide to study more is that you better be damn sure of what jobs are available after your post secondary education.  do not end up prefer me
i am 40,ive been doing 350 mg test /week and 0. 5 -1 mg dutasteride per day and i still have more hair falling out than i am comfortable with.    hopefully its shedding and not pure loss.    but after this 1st cycle of mine i do not think ill be touching gear.  i am going to get hairline surgery in the next 1-3 years so i do not want it to be counter productive.    maybe when i am 40+ and hairfall has naturally taken its toll ill consider gear again
i am 5,i am 5'6 most ive ever been naturally is 160.  i am trying to break that barrier this cycle.  i am doing 350 mg test for 12-15 weeks
i am 24,i did not.  could not ask my dad any of those points raised under .   he was/ is there for us but in a super authoritarian way which has effed my too this day.  i am 24 still living at home and not much going for me.    i am seriously planning the best way to become independent from him. 
i am 25,i am 25 and feel and look prefer 45
i am 25,i am 25 and so far i have only suffered with my art making
i am 25,i am so fucking depressed everytime i try to draw something.  its prefer my life is prefer that movie groundhog day.  wake up and  get inspired and  try to draw something nice and  get my dreams broken over how mentally unorganized my brain is and  and die a little more each time it happens and start over the next day believing things can be different but end the same.  this shit started when i was 13 and i am 25 now so there's no reason to believe that i will ever do anything with my life.  must be nice being talented and being gifted the correct mental genes at birth from the get go
i am 22,i am 22.  by young women i mean pretty much all women <30/ 35. 
i am 5,> you do not have to do shit.  the reason people do not prefer you or want to be around you is not the way you look and  it's your awful 'incels' personality.   i act normal in real life.  i do not talk about anything prefer women's privileges because it's socially unacceptable.   > you're making excuses for why you can't better yourself.  you'll never get better if you do not do something about it.  i would say act prefer yourself and maybe a girl might find you one day but you should probably try to hide what we're reading here from everyone else.   i can  and  i just need 20k+ worth of plastic surgery.  no amount of personality improvements will make it possible for me to get a woman when they can just use okcupid/ tinder and get a dozen messages from guys more attractive than me in a hour.   > edit: i've never worked out a day in my life and have had no problem and  something tells me you're not telling everyone the full story.  nobody needs to work out unless you want to look fit/toned or you weigh 300lbs.  nobody wants to say they weigh 300lbs and that's why they're afraid to leave the house and work out.   i am not fat and  i am 5'6-5'7 and 150-160 pounds.  i might be a tiny bit overweight but i can lose that in less than a month.  the only reason i  to work out is because i am short and  ugly and  balding and  etc.  i need to have one attractive trait at least and  until i can get plastic surgery. 
i am 20,well i am not too sure about america as i do not live there and  but according to  most of the states have age of consent laws under 18.   > the burden of proof is generally on the person claiming something can or does happen.  try again!  fine and  i will admit it's not a fact an adult can prefer someone under 18 because i have no proof of that.  will you admit there is no proof an adult can't prefer someone under 18? there is no proof of that either and  it's just an assumption.   > 17 gets you a majority .  sixteen doesn't within the us and  going off of population .  and you really ought to look at canada's law and  it's not quite   i meant the majority of the west and  not the majority of america.   > i prefer that your argument against what canada's government says about its own law is   > how about this: you're claiming a specific interpretation of canadian law counter to the plain meaning of the words  and  and that the age gap would only come into play at   > have a citation for us and  mr.  facts and logic?  no and  neither of us do.  16 is the age of consent but how much you have to be older for it to be statutory rape is unclear.  could be 25 and  30 and  40 and  etc.   at the very least it should be legal for a 16 year old and a 20 year old to have sex and  which means adults can have sex with minors in canada.  which was my point on /r/justneckbeardthings.   > except you were not making an appeal to whether it was legal and  but rather that if it were wrong it would be illegal.   ah.  they said 16-17 years are incapable of consent and  i asked them if they had proof and just added in if they were not capable of consent the 16 age of consent likely would not be as common.  i was not saying it's a fact they can consent because the age of consent is usually 16 and  just that i find it hard to believe when the age of consent is usually 16.   > honest talk and  though: please tell me you're at most 20.  the  attitude is decidedly less abjectly horrifying coming from someone for whom that represents less time and  and who can still think about themselves as a 16-year-old and feel prefer they're basically the same.    i am 20. 
i am 2 years older,i was a neet for 2 years and i just regret the time i wasted away doing absolutely nothing.   granted and  the first year was partly due to family troubles but the next year was just purely a lack of motivation.    i posted a more detailed summary of what i did during those years on this subreddit if anybody wants to read that on my profile.   i am currently in college and blending in prefer a regular college student in the freshman dorms.  even have a girlfriend right now.  my social skills were good in high school and they did not detiriorate too much so i get along with everyone fine.  nobody knows i am 2 years older than all them and  not even my girlfriend.   feel free to pm me or reply if you want to ask or talk about some stuff

i am 25,yeah same situation as you.  i am 25 but feel more prefer ~20.  lately i feel prefer my age is catching up to me.  i think i need to change my wardrobe to match my age more because i think i am starting to look silly in the clothes i wore when i was 18.   in terms of milestones and stuff prefer that and  i do not think i developed normally or at the same pace as my peers .  i think one of my biggest problems was sexual/relationship development.  relating to other humans is one of the most important things .  i was repressed a lot growing up and  and i think my parents did a bad job at guiding me to develop into a healthy person.  i have a lot of memories growing up of my parents saying incorrect and  probably harmful things to me.  things prefer i shouldn't have sex until i am 21 and  i shouldn't date and  i should never look at porn again .  i am sure they said a lot of helpful/correct things and  but boy does it seem prefer all of my memories are negative.   they also failed me when it came to helping me cultivate interests/hobbies/passions.  i think they tried to jam me into a mold they wanted me to fit in and  they forced me to do activities they deemed appropriate and respectable and  and repressed things that i enjoyed.  i've been trying to live for myself and trying to sort out everything they messed up with me and  because at the end of the day we all turn into adults and live for ourselves and  not our parents.  we actually get to make our own decisions one day! who would've thought.   i do not blame them entirely and  i might just be a weirdo and being a weirdo + incompetent parents might've turned me into the manchild and  lazy and  no motivation neet i am today.  i think my developmental years were really messed up and  the amount of contradiction and weirdness that went on.

i am 5,sure go ahead and  i've been turning stuff over prefer this in my head too.  > what happens on the day that they stop? will there be a time where you think you could be out on your own?  yes there might be a day when i am on my own.  i might even want to be a normie/wageslave for my own good and health.  it might not be that bad.  i might be able to create a life for myself i am content with and/or enjoy.  if it came to it and  my family has the funds to support me for life.  i am not sure if they would.  i am pretty positive they are going to set my severly autistic uncle up for life .   &nbsp;  > in general? why are you posting here? we're people.  same as them.   i am not fully sure what my deal is with people.  i still have a need for socialization.  i mainly satisfy it through typing to people online and  sometimes voice talking and  and seeing my family frequently.   talking with people online is okay with me.  i think i've developed a system of socializing that works for me and satisfies my needs in a healthy way.  this might be something i dig into more or face more in the future and  for now my system works and i see nothing wrong with it.   &nbsp;  > sounds prefer maybe you should look at it a different way? i can't say it's depression because i am not a mental health professional and  but it sounds depressing.    i was definitely sick and burned out of schoolslaving.  there was no point for me there and  i hated all of it.  i would've been in a horrible place if i stayed there.  now and  i am 5 years into my neetdom and  and i am seriously lacking motivation to do anything big or majorly productive and  ideally sustained over a long period of time .  i've been trying to think about the formula of motivation.  i did a lot of what i wanted and i completed a lot of personal goals during my neetdom.  i've been bored lately and thinking my brain might do well with some monotonous school-prefer long sustained work.  the thought of being in a social environment again hinders me.  i am also hindered by not having a teacher's guidance and assistance .  i am in no real rush to get back out in the world and  or to start making money.  in the end i might just not work well around people.  i know i can't avoid them all together but i might sustain a lifestyle with limited in real life human contact.  i might've dipped into a very light form of depression within the past few months and  but i think it's mostly dissipated as i am now considering working towards doing healthy and productive things and  and having a new goal to achieve.    &nbsp;  > so moving backwards and  avoiding responsibility and  is a breath of fresh air? i hope one day you can reconsider.    i am not exactly sure what you mean by this.  neetdom is basically living retired.  as far as i am aware and  nothing is wrong with being retired? neetdom definitely did wonders for my mental and physical health and well being.  i got to achieve awesome goals that meant a lot to me and i did/learned many new things.  i think i will look back on my neetdom very positively.  i took control of my life and did what was right for me.  i had the resources so why not do what's right for yourself if you can? i do not think life's a race.  i am taking things at my own pace and doing my best to make the right decisions with the resources i have.  i was lucky enough to be able to choose to get out of a life i could not stand.    &nbsp;   >this is important.  serious.  keep going with whatever goals you have.  do not do the same goal every day.  increase it just a little bit if you can.    thank you very much for the motivation and  sir or maam.     &nbsp;  edit: yeah it does feel a bit bad i’m not one of society’s cogs working for mother country for these past 5 years still slaving away blindly marching to the beat of someone else’s drum for no reason whatsoever other than to be marching to someone else’s drum.  i do feel bad i’ve been a bit “lazy” but you know what fuck em.  i’m using what resources i have to try make a life i enjoy. 
i am 20,there's no toughness in enduring pain and  only a fool takes pain with no reward.    i am 20 and  but since i was about 13 i realised suicide was the likely option rather than fail at dealing with growing older and  due to a complete social ineptitude and  and by 16 physical issues mean my eyes get extremely sore and constantly distorted.    there's no happy rainbow as a reward for pain and  happy people are more successful and  productive while the sad people constantly fail and become distanced from society.  i doubt i can really relate to most people here and  as there was literally a thread about posting pictures with friends lol
i am 22,i definitely was not prefer this when i was little.  i was as socially anxious kid growing up and  with some avoidant tendencies.  then one day my brain figured out how to get rid of the anxiety and  and it did its job so well that all other emotions just dissapeared.  i would say the symptoms started appearing at about 16 y. o.  now i am 22 and they are worsening day by day.  scares me to think about the future. 
i am 22,do not feel prefer typing a really long reply but just know that there's someone else out there that's almost exactly prefer you.  i am 22 as well and my life is largely similar to yours.   >moreover and  there’s no drive or motivation to uphold beliefs and  opinions and  values and  dreams etc.  because i’m not really emotionally invested in many things  > i have a fair few hobbies and  but no desire to master the craft/make a living off it  relate to all this totally
i am 22,i have asd.  i suffered greatly in my early life and  but my parents did not give up on me.  they showered me with prefer and gave me all the support they could give.  i am 22 now.  i can now pass off as a fully-functional and capable adult.  no one can tell i have asd unless i tell them.  i did well throughout school and am in my final year of university.  my parents are very proud of me.  i know it might sound hard to believe now and  but asd becomes more manageable as the person ages.  i assure you it gets better.  get a therapist specializing in asd.  it'll help greatly and  both for you and your son. 
i am 23,i do not take drugs at all and  do not smoke and  do not drink much either.  basically i never did anything that would lead to this and my had no traumatic events in my childhood so i think it's just purely genetic in my case which just makes it all the more annoying because i have absolutely nothing to blame for it.  i am 23 right now and i noticed these symptoms at about 20.  before that i always had the traits but they were much milder.  do you also have close to 0 sex drive?
i am 22,female neet here.  while i can't speak for the majority of neetdom and  i can give you my perspective on how i feel about this predicament i am in.  i am 22 and  been a neet for about 3 or 4 years and  and also have only a high school diploma.  i've struggled with mental health issues since i was about 10 or 11 and  and while it's gotten better it's still somewhat debilitating.  i turned out okay considering my terrible childhood and  though i could have done more with myself.  i think i was just destined to be a neet and  as i could not really make friends or blend in with others.   to answer your questions: i am most definitely a virgin by choice and  i am somewhat ashamed to be unproductive and  and i feel prefer i do not have any opportunities that would benefit me in the long run.  i do not feel bad about being a virgin and  and have actually come to embrace a sexless life.  whether that's due to trauma or potentially being asexual and  i do not know nor do i care.  i am unattractive anyway and  so it's not prefer i am going to go out and fuck whoever i want.  besides and  sex seems pretty overrated.   as aforementioned and  i do feel a little bad for not doing much with my pathetic life.  at the same time and  i did not really have a plan in life and never asked to be born.  so and  i just take up space since my multiple suicide attempts never worked in my favor.  i can't say that there's many employers who'll take in someone with my qualifications .  overall and  being a neet is a double-edged sword.   on one hand and  you do not have to work at some dead-end job that'll drive you further to suicide.  on the other hand and  there's a feeling of wanting more out of life not to mention barely scraping by with such a low income.  there really is no win-win situation: you just weigh the pros and cons and determine which is the lesser of two evils.  i do not plan on living for too long anyway and  so i might as well exist in this god-forsaken world doing what i enjoy.  some people just are not meant to be happy or live fulfilling lives. 
i am 99,yeah i am applying for major depression anxiety and ptsd.  i bombed the interview and i am 99. 8% sure somebody else got the spot.  i embarrassed myself and now i feel prefer i can't return to the only walmart in town.  this was the only accepted interview i've had in years.  my gut knew i was not ready for this.  it seems prefer a cop-out to get disability for depression but i feel prefer i really need it if i am ever going to have any semblance of a life.  i am a massive fucking failure and today just proved it to me again.   thanks for the post though i appreciate that people invest time into others on here. 
i am 24,i am 24 and suffer from the same ailments.  the only thing i can tell you for certain is that it won't get better if you do not fight it.  if it seems logical in your head and  it's probably not.  life is not about being comfortable and  i wish i would've learned that a long time ago.  my anxiety has kept me from doing very basic things.  i do not have a drivers license and  never had a job and  dropped out of community college.  all because of the same things you go through.    i was bullied in school and i used to beg my mom to let me stay home.  fearing the next day just prefer you do.  perhaps not for the same reasons.  you're aware that people do not give a shit and that's probably going to be your greatest asset.  comparing yourself to others is the enemy and will kick start depression faster than anything else.    as far as getting 'over' it.  i have nothing and  as i have not. 
i am 21,i really and  really and  feel you on this post.  i am 21 too and have been neet for 14 months.  when i was 15 i had a 23 year old friend who was on the  of being a math prodigy.  she went to university at 15 and graduated at 19.  i only even survived high school sophomore year thanks to her tutoring me.  it absolutely crushes me inside knowing how much more she achieved than i have and  and at such earlier ages too. 
i am 5,"do you even know how bad it feels internally to be that short and/or have a small dick? i am 5'4"" too and it genuinely makes me want to die on a daily basis. "
i am 8,i am 8 inches shorter than you.  if magic were real and we traded heights for the rest of our lives and  you would murder me out of resentment or for the slightest possibility of getting yours back. 
i am 5,"honestly dude and  i am glad you're trying to help the guy but that's just not completely true.  height doesn't preclude depression of course and depression makes you hate yourself regardless of who/what you are and  but tall guys literally have it way better than short guys in every single way.  straight women and gay men both consider tall height much more attractive than short height.  any prestigious job is overwhelmingly more likely to be represented by people of your height than his.  tall people make a shit ton more money than short people.  most tall people prefer being tall and most short people hate being short.  tall vs short and  especially in men and  is as close as life can get to the grass being objectively green on one side and completely dead dry brown on the other.  i am 5'4"" male and will commit suicide about it soon and it doesn't help all that much when tall people insist height doesn't matter. "
i am 26,miserable and clueless about the future.  i am 26 now and  but feel prefer 80. 
i am 41,this is the most realistic advice given to me in this thread.  i am 41 and i've lived long enough to know i am screwed.  my entire life is one failure after another.  the issues i've been talking about here happened years and years ago and have haunted me in my 20's and 30's as well.  i am here to say that even years later and  it's only gotten worse. 
i am 5,"you're 6 foot tall and  taller than 80%  of men.  i am 5'5"" and  shorter than 90% or more of men. "
i am 5,"i agree and  but i do not really prefer being out around other people either.  people usually stare at me and  prefer i am so ugly i am the elephant man or something.  i am 5'6"" or less and  less than average looking and  but other than that i do not bother anybody so i do not know what the problem is.  when i am out and  after awhile and  i am just thinking about being home and doing what i prefer to do.  it's not prefer i interact with many people when i am out.  on the bus and  i am on my phone and  reading news and  listening to music.  there are not many ways to interact with people or meet new people after a certain age.  i could not even do it when i was younger.  i've done things by myself for a long time. "
i am 41,"i am 41 and  sadly.  but i feel prefer a child since i am only 5'6"". "
i am 5,been thinking about your post and my height all day.  i can't believe i am 5'5.  nothing works.  now i have years of failure to think about every single day.  i hate even going outside because i notice how short i am.  it's that bad. 
i am 15,i have them and i am 15.  got them a few months ago.  sucks to see that they do not go away.  i might opt in for the yag surgery to get them removed if the operation is safe .   edit: wow and  judging from the popularity of  video and  floaters must be more common than i originally thought.  maybe they are rare for younger people. 
i am 16,i am 16 myself.  110 pounds at 5'9 is not healthy.  being underweight is an established risk factor for osteoporosis and  even for young people.    you are either exercising a lot and  drastically underestimating the amount of calories you're getting and  or have some absorption issues.  2400-2500 calories should be enough to be gaining 1/2 - 1 pound/week at that height and weight.   edit: not to mention being weak and constantly receiving comments about your weight. 
i am 18,hey all and  i am amira.  you can call me rosy or milkita too.    i live in 'murica: more specifically california.  i am lebanese and white.    i am 18 and  but i will be 19 in september.  i am a community college student and  but i wish i was not because school sux  aside from slicing up my forearm and  i prefer to draw and  sing and  cook and  do my nails and  and learn languages.  i've been studying spanish for 5 years and  so if you want to hmu in spanish go ahead b)
i am 27,since i was 19 and  got weeded out at 18 and had to appeal.  i am 27 next month and it's honestly not enough to live
i am 2 hours,watching back where i am 2 hours ago. 
i am 25,1.  3 years  2.  i am 25 3.  most definitely if i put in the effort 4.  data entry or some door to door service i guess  and  will probably give me some motivation to get more educated in advanced jobs.   the market and economy is still fuckked though
i am 25,that villain from part 8 and  who was 23 and bald.  because i am 25 and bald rn :c
i am 64,i do not know.  i am 64 as well and my damage just  feels bad? two of our 60-70 abilities are garbage and   and  and the rotation seems super dependant on rng for good damage.  i've had entire durations of minuet not yield a full 3 stack for pitch perfect. 
i am 21,started when i was six and  i am 21
i am 26,i am 26 and  but i did go to college so i've only been neet since i was 22. 
i am 26,you're dating my mom.     i definitely could not tolerate dating someone prefer that and  because my limit has already been maxed out by interacting with my mom.  i am 26 and she tells me when to hug my brother hello and goodbye and  tells me i shut the car door too loudly and  that i will break my skull if i learn to ride a bicycle and  that i am not being polite enough to various strangers and  and when i stay the night she always shows me where my pajamas are even though the drawer never moves and is actually labeled  nothing i've said has gotten across to her and  so this is not about logic but about her needing to fill an emotional hole by treating me prefer i am helpless.    anyways and  this is probably some form of anxiety and  which  is treatable by both therapy and meds both of which my mom refuses to try.  i will always keep my mom in my life because despite driving me up the wall she's _my mom_ and  but i dread the thought of choosing someone prefer that to be my life partner.     story time: she thought it was really funny one time in an airport where i grabbed her hand prefer she was a lost little child  and did all the figuring out of where to go and  because i was treating her the way she treated me when i was little.  it was one of the few times she briefly acknowledged that i've grown into a competent adult.  years later she had a nightmare that ended with me popping out of nowhere and  grabbing her hand prefer she was the child and  and rescuing her. 
i am 5,i am 5'6 and 18 i feel you
i am 22,i am 22 and  and i find myself becoming distant with almost everybody.  the only people i have stayed close to over the years have been close family members.  i am very close to my siblings and  parents and grandparents.  that's it.    my best friend and i have been friends for 10 years now.  we used to hangout at least once a week.  i have not heard from him for almost 2 months now and  because he's too busy raising a kid he stupidly had with a single mom.    i absolutely agree with the bit on talking with women.  literally 99% of what comes out of a woman's mouth is bitching and  gossip and empty nonsense.    mgtow is a necessary but sometimes lonely road to take.  i enjoy my solitude and  but i also enjoy being around close friends every once in awhile.  i've been looking to make new friends and  because the older i get and  the more i realize that the guys i've been hanging around have nothing in common with me.  i can't stand the normie nonsense. 
i am 22,you're spot on about the living at home thing.    i am 22 and live with my grandparents.  really nice people and we get along great.  i do some flipping on ebay and make a solid $1 and 400/month right now.  doesn't sound prefer a lot and  but when you're living at home it really adds up and  especially when you do not go and blow all of it on nonsense items.    i know normies are needed to work the menial jobs to keep society afloat and  but i do not know why people strive to do such a thing.    i was making $2 and 400/month at an office job 2 years ago and owned a 2 bed apartment.  after expenses i had maybe $500 at most to myself each month.  that was with 45-50/hr workweeks and  too.    now and  i put in around 10-12/week ebaying and after what little expenses i have here i have twice the money to myself.    i prefer hearing the  nonsense.  who the fuck even cares lol? i am happy here.  plus and  i am not stuck getting cabin fever in an apartment.  i can go outside and read and  shoot some hoops or tend to our garden.  feelsgoodman
i am 6,your parents' genetics do not always play into effect in regards to physical attributes.  my father is 5'4.   i am 6'2 and  as is my uncle.  i am pretty sure that side of the family is where i got it from. 
i am 5,"you sound almost prefer me but i am 5'9"" and  middle eastern and ripped.  also still feel prefer i have to put in some work and get a lot of rejections still.  either way and  the blackpill never leaves you"
i am 29,i am 29 and pretty sure a lot of people in this sub around the same age or older.  anyways and  if i was not someone's option let alone first-choice for a one night stand and  then why would i be in a relationship with someone who doesn't physically value me as a sexual being.   makes me feel prefer they're either  or money is the main part of the equation. 
i am 5,"basically that.  i would always been told i am far from badlooking but i always felt prefer i was fairly average and nothing remarkable.  plus i am 5'9"""
i am 29,lost my v-card.  i am 29 now
i am 5,eli5 = explain it prefer i am 5. 
i am 25,i am 25 year old and can sign up under every fucking word written there.     'i wish frankly i was never born. '
i am 25,i am 25 and can affirm that is truthful.  my short-term memory decreased significantly and  i can barely remember words or names from first attempt.    2 years of neet life with barely going out and chatting to people.    thanks my  fucking parents for trash genetics and the way my life developed. 
i am 18,yeah and  i do not even feel 25 wtf and  its prefer i am 18 yo inside
i am 25,balding is a death sentence   i am 25 and norwood reaper knocking on my door   nw6 difuse pattern and  rapidly going   in few months my social execution will be held
i am 25,sure and  as long as he gave me sugar.  it doesn't have to be extravagant and  but i would prefer shopping trips and  nice dinners and  gifts and somesuch every month.  i am 25 and i actually  men between 30 - 40.  
i am 25,i am 25 and i sugar.  i must be ancient!  there are plenty of men who  older women.  a lot of older men  an appropriately aged escort because they're more mature and  intelligent and can blend in with the crowd.  a 22 year old on the arm of a 60 year old man = obvious escort.  just take care of your looks and market yourself appropriately. 
i am 25,i am 25 and 21 is extremely young to me.  it's not a big deal unless you make it a big deal. 
i am 6,eh do not think too much about it.  if you're an outgoing person that is far more important than height.  i am 6'4 and  24 yrs old and have never had a girlfriend.  a friend of mine is 5'10 and outgoing and  he's with a new girl every month. 
i am 24,looking prefer a loser to my family and everyone i grew up with.  all my old high school friends are out there chasing their dreams and  finishing up great degrees and getting into some of the best careers.  i do not have the motivation or the intelligence to get a degree in one of the tech/engineering fields.  i just hate that i am 24 years old and have not achieved any more than a 17 year old graduating high school. 
i am 6,you guys act prefer height is everything.  i am 6'4 and  mid twenties and never had a girlfriend or a girl even interested in me.  probably because i am hideous but height doesn't magically make women interested in you. 
i am 24,yep and  i am 24 and have made about as much progress in life as a 16 year old.  after high school i just became a total shut in.  unfortunately i am too much of a coward to kill myself so i do not know how i can get this burden off of my parents.   no higher education and  no skills in anything and the only job experience i've had was being a cashier.  i fucked up my life so badly and i want out
i am 23,i feel the same because i am 23 and still stuck as a cashier.  my social anxiety has put me in a hole that is impossible to get out of as well.  i feel your pain and  i wish i had some advice to give you but you are not alone my friend. 
i am 23,everyone goes at their own pace and  this is something i have a hell of a hard time trying to tell myself but it's true.  i am 23 and i am just now restarting college.  a lot of people just are not ready to decide on a major right after high school.  do not give up my dude
i am 23,i am embarrassed to be in the position i am in.  i am 23 with a shitty part-time cashier job.  live at home and  never go outside unless it's to work.  no friends and  no girlfriend and  i am a complete fuck up. 
i am 23,yep and  i am 23 and feeling the same way.  i have 0 motivation to change even though i desperately want to.  i've failed out of college so many times because i do not have a clue what field i want to go into.  i was told i would have a passion to follow by now but i have nothing and i do not see anything coming anytime soon. 
i am 23,i feel you.  i am 23 and my family does the same thing and  it sucks to not be supported especially when you have this crippling illness.  it's just impossible for them to understand :(
i am 6,you had a rough upbringing and  it's not your fault.  i can relate in some ways as i am currently watching my 18 yr old sister achieve more than i have and i am 6 years older.  i am unemployed and all that stuff but what i can give advice on is your weight.  i am still overweight but the one thing that has been working for me is calorie counting.  it's time consuming at first but you have the time in your position.  give the app myfitnesspal a shot if you have not already.    i can relate to a lot of what you said here and  if it makes you feel any better you're not alone. 
i am 23,hey and  i just got my license recently too and i am 23.  i also failed the test two times before i passed on my 3rd attempt.  it was rough but keep practicing and you'll feel amazing once you actually get it.  good luck. 
i am 23,no and  i am 23 and i do it all the time.

i am 16,hi and  i am 16 and  i used to watch anime and i still play video games all day and  i will pm you. 
i am 28,hi there buddy and  i am 28 and neeted probably for 10 years too.  i have completely wasted my time and  what have you done with yours?
i am 28,its ok buddy and  i am 28 and i do not have any friends
i am 28,i am 28 and  almost 10 years of neet for me.  so how do you feel about getting part time jobs or joining some free courses? you think it will help?
i am 28,hi i am 28 and  8-9 years for me  do you have any plans or whatever?
i am 23,this has been me ever since i was 16.  i am 23 now.  it's such a meaningless existence
i am 23,i am 23 and i feel prefer i won't make it to 30
i am 23,i am 23 too and i would prefer to do this and  but my physical and mental health is so bad at the moment
i am 23,weird and  the first part of your story is very similar to mine.  i dropped out of school at 14 and have been housebound ever since.  i am 23 now and my grandmother passed away last december  then i had to move in with my mum.  it's hard to relate to anyone in our position and  but there are subreddits for people in our situation.  it's  prefer group therapy and  just posting and venting in them
i am 27,i am 27 and have $30k in super
i am 22,me too.  probably my entire life up to now has been messed up by this and  because i do not actually do any of the things i want to do.  instead i look for more books/articles/movies and  and just end up collecting them and never reading/watching anything.  i am 22 and i do not know shit about shit because and  well and  there's more shit to put on my reading list.  it's terrible.    came here from a google search on books about procrastination and  then i realized that i am probably not even going to read those and  and even if i do and  it's just prefer a more advanced form of it.  i am not going to do the *other* things i want to do because of it.

i am 20,i am 20 but i feel prefer i am 12 and i feel prefer everyone views me as a child and  but i think that is just because i feel prefer one.   but its really weird on tinder and flirting with people etc i freak out because it feels wrong because theyre adults  and i am not.  prefer it's really odd living and interacting with people who view me as a senior in college but i still feel prefer a middle schooler.  it's extremely frustrating and  but it's had a huge impact on my sex life because everything just feels wrong because i do not feel adult enough to do anything sexual.  ive moved out and  i pay bills and  granted i am young but i am a young adult not a young adolescent   idk i just really feel you.  it's incredibly frustrating and  depressing

i am 27,> it's over.  just waiting to die of old age at this point and  only 60 or so years to go.   cmon man and  you've been given a gift and you do not even know it.  i am 27 myself and  and i was depressed as hell after my first  breakup.  took almost 2 years to get out of that shithole but i finally reached the acceptance phase and i am ready to open up to the world again.  but this time around i will approach it differently.  cup halfway full rather than halfway empty!      >mgtow has some good points.  after my first breakup i discovered r/theredpill and r/asktrp then i eventually decided i fit in better with r/mgtow      nice and  i pretty much went the exact same route as you did! but never checked out /r/incels and  i will check that out. 
i am 18,17 & 18.  do not sweat it.  i am 18 and i had the same thoughts as you after a break up about four months ago and  eventually you move on.  know that your life has just begun and there are many more fish in the sea. 
i am 19,i am 19 years old and i did exactly that recently. 
i am 22,well and  i was on /b/ when i was a kid.  maybe 11-12 years old starting? i am 22 now.  i have to say it really began with efg.  after fuuu- hit and  memes started coming out in new ways and  still in the four square format but they slowly started changing.  i would have to say the change in meme culture was when the normies got a hold of it.  ie.  black twitter. 
i am 5,i am 5'10 and  138 lbs.  and  have maintained that weight for years with literally no effort.  i eat when i am hungry and  i do not eat what i not and  and my exercise is usually out of necessity prefer having to walk places and carry stuff upstairs. 
i am 26,genetics and  antidepressants and  other medications and  poor diet and  vitamin deficiencies and  and various medical conditions.    i feel your pain and  i am 26 and gradually losing ground in front.  :(
i am 22,i am 22 and never had a job.  luckily i am going to community college and  dad is paying for it.  been a neet since high school and  started college at 21 and  so been a neet for some years.  i have been hearing that volunteering is a great way to get some experience and  i am looking into that. 
i am 22,i have been a neet for prefer 2. 5/3 years.  i am 22 and  started community college at 21.  still never had a job but and  going to college is getting me out of my shell a little.  by that i mean the only time i ever step foot outside is to go to class or shop for food.  but atleast i am starting to go outside more.  still have a ways to go though .   .   .  i am trying to break free to anon.  .  .  lets succeed!
i am 23,i am 23 and been neet since december 2014. 
i am 23,sorry to sound a bit harsh and  but you have to stop thinking of yourself as being old and unable to change.  i know it sounds prefer a cliche and  but age is really just a number and society seems to focus on age a bit too much.   i am 23 years old and  have aspergers and  anxiety disorder and  and depression.  even though things seem really hopeless right now and have for a very long time and  you can't just give up.  there are plenty of people who are late bloomers who find success and happiness at later points in their life.   also and  it appears that you are basing your opinion based on what people on the internet have to say.  reddit can often be one of the worst places to get advice because people can say whatever they want and it is almost impossible for other people to understand exactly what you are going through.  i've personally found myself to be the healthiest mentally when i stop asking reddit for advice. 
i am 23,i am 23 years old and have also been a neet for 2 years since graduating college.  i've actually applied to nearly 100 jobs and  but have not had any success getting hired.  in the rare event i get an interview and  i seem to be too socially awkward for them to actually consider hiring me.   i've pretty much given up trying to get a job that a requires a college education and i am planning on getting a forklift operator certificate .  it sounds prefer being a forklift operator would be a pretty good job since it requires minimal social skills  and there are always companies looking to hire people in the warehouse.  if you are a night owl there are also plenty of opportunities to get an overnight job in the warehouse.  i know forklift operators do not make too much money and  but it is definitely a step up from being a neet. 
i am 23,i am pretty similar to you when you were in your early 20s.  i am 23 now and i graduated with a degree 2 years ago.  i have not been able to find a job to save my life and  despite applying for hundreds.  the problem is i majored in something that i do not really have an interest in working in anymore  and  and i have no idea what else i can do at this point.   yes motivation is an issue and  but it was not always.  for around the first 6 months of being a neet i applied for tons of jobs and  even retail and  and either never got an interview and  or got rejected at the interview.  i honestly have no idea what else i can do at this point because i feel prefer i did put an effort in to begin my life and  but i literally can not catch a break at all.   i am glad that things have worked out for you though.  i am hoping that things work out for me too and  but i feel prefer there is not much else i can do at this point.  everything seems out of my control right now because i literally have nothing to offer anyone right now and  and no one wants to take a chance on hiring me.  i was also considering going back to school and  but i am afraid that the same thing will happen all over again.  i literally have no confidence in my ability to find a job. 
i am 23,hey i am 23 as well and  and in a similar situation as you.  the challenges that you described are exactly what i am facing right now.  i could go to a local employment agency and  and maybe end this neet lifestyle once and for all and  but i can't find the motivation to do it because i am literally addicted to the comfort i feel right now.   there are very few neet communities out there and  probably because this lifestyle is usually short term for most people.  many of us are also dealing with issues such as depression and  which is turn leads to negative posts.  it is also important to understand that most of us are posting here because we do not have any  on how to improve our lives.  if we knew what we were doing we would not have to post here anymore.    there is no rule that says you can't be positive here though.  i would welcome posts here that discuss learning new skills or motivating people to leave the house.  feel free to start making posts here if you wish.  you could also try posting on /r/jobs since many struggling unemployed people post there.  just understand that most of the people who post there have no idea what it's prefer to live this lifestyle long term and  and make it sound prefer cold calling an employer and  or going to an employment agency should just be a simple and  routine task. 
i am 22,there are plenty of successful people who spend hours playing video games.  unless you have a serious addiction to video games and  there is no reason why someone should have to give them up entirely.  the key is to find balance between doing productive activities and non productive hobbies such as video games.   i am 22 years old and  have a university degree and  very little experience and  and applied for well over 50 jobs.  the truth is the job market sucks right now and people will always look to blame the unemployed person rather than blame society.  it's bullshit but all you can you is keep applying and hope to catch a break.  temp agencies or volunteer work might also be something to consider as well and  in certain situations they can be helpful for finding employment. 
i am 26,i am 26 and still having all these issues and  good on you for taking charge into your own hands and not sinking deeper into distractions prefer some of us did
