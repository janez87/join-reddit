i am a girl,i blame english professors for this.   they *prefer* to bring up topics where students can write passionately and honestly.    unfortunately and  that's all they do - just agitate the surface.  students end up with the tl;dr version.  these concepts are in the realm of sociology and  psychology and  women's studies and  etc.  you know and  the liberal arts.   now and  sexual identity and gender identity is vastly different.   sexual identity is loosely: hetero- or homo- and  but there's stuff prefer asexual and  bisexual and  and it's many variants prefer pansexual which is fine - but really does a number on 18 year olds who have not yet figured out their own identities yet; especially after the clique-based society known as high school has left them with trauma.  resulting in more and more  because they're just people trying to fit in a world where they're all alone and isolated - aka college.   gender identity is.  well let's say it's the same shit.    i am a boy and  so i get a blue blanket - cars and trucks for toys and  and i should aspire to be an astronaut.   i am a girl and  so i get a pink blanket - stuff animals for toys and  and i should aspire to be a fashion designer.   these are gender roles.  people are now:  i am a cis-bi-male-cat-tangram-sexual so i get a blanket of snow - abraham lincoln vampire hunter for toys and  and i should aspire to be bubble wrap.   ---  so and  i am just going to say it first.   you're a human being and  be whatever you want to be - do not get specific in what you are because you're always changing.  if you want to get super specific and  do it on your epitaph.  be vague so other people can understand.  you have a penis and  cool - go to the boy's bathroom and  there are urinals and  it's super convenient.  you have a period every month and  so sorry - go to the girl's bathroom and  there's a garbage can in each stall.    end. 
i am a man,“once upon a time and  i dreamt i was a butterfly and  fluttering hither and thither and  to all intents and purposes a butterfly.  i was conscious only of my happiness as a butterfly and  unaware that i was myself.  soon i awaked and  and there i was and  veritably myself again.  now i do not know whether i was then a man dreaming i was a butterfly and  or whether i am now a butterfly and  dreaming i am a man. ”  ― zhuangzi
i am a guy,i am a guy and  but i think aiming your frustration towards women is pointless.     you assume all female neets want a relationship and  marriage and kids.   that they are happy with a minimum wage  job and do not have introspection.   also your issue seems to be mainly with basic evolutionary behavior.   how is it women's fault that men are desperate/programmed to seek out women.   by your logic and  you should be equally upset with men. 
i am a short guy,&#x200b;  what do you guys think of these:    &#x200b;  i plan on wearing them with dark jeans and a polo shirt.  is that a good look? can i basically just wear them prefer boat shoes? i do not prefer boat shoes because they are flat and i am a short guy and  but these shoes look prefer they have a good heel to them.

i am a guy,>i am not trying to be a dick and  but your friends luxuries are not anyone's concern.  if a child has rights and  she cannot kill it.  period.    you're missing my point.  i am not talking about what's just and  i am talking about what *happens*.  because abortion is legal and  this process is allowed to move forward in an open and  transparent and healthy way and  *which in this case is even working out better for the fetus*.   >well i do not see how you could.  it's not specifically easy to legislate rape accusations and  for example.  it very often breaks down to a he said/she said argument and the court needs to make a very subjective determination about whether consent was given and  implied and  or whether there's even enough evidence.    but rape being illegal doesn't actively make things *worse*.  it's not just about difficulty to convict and  it's about the effect the law has.  even if the conviction rate is low and  the illegality of rape creates more safe places and situations for women and  and lowers the total number of rapes by forcing rapists to be more cautious.   making abortion illegal and  however and  would just push a lot of pregnancies into the shadows and  and make back-alley/coathanger abortions a common occurrence again.    >what? i could say the exact same things about eating a bucket of fried chicken.  you make the choice to become impregnated and  just prefer you'd make a choice to eat an entire bucket of fried chicken.  the consequences are no one's but your own.  i know in this entitled generation we prefer to blame everyone but ourselves for our problems and  but no it's not a matter of  to murder a child because you do not want it after you willingly put it there.    first and  i think you're pretty wildly under-estimating just how serious a thing pregnancy is.  the mental effects of hormones alone are pretty severe.  i would put pregnancy about on par with organ donation.  i also do not think that eating a bucket of fried chicken carries much immediate risk of death.   second and   is a bit of a grey area and  as it is at least an unintended consequence and  and there is the possibility of rape and  failed birth control and  etc.  and anyone can claim that their pregnancy was the result of one of those and  and whose to say otherwise?  third and most crucially is the fact that a pregnancy is an ongoing thing and  which is where your bucket of chicken analogy really falls down.  this is more prefer being force-fed the bucket of chicken you bought but now regret.   >virtually all of your arguments are made from a personal sense of entitlement that simply is not protected under the law and  and shouldn't be.  you do not have a right to convenience and  luxury and  or complete freedom of action.  you do not have a right to offload the consequences of your actions on to society.  in fact and  these would all be positive rights and  and under current law you do not have any positive rights.  you have negative rights and  which means someone can't do things to you.  you have no right that someone has to do something for you or provide any service to you.    think you edited that in after i was already typing my reply and  so hope you see this response.  anyway.   >  you realize that i am a guy and  right? and in fact and  i am a guy arguing that men should be required to pay child support even if they did not want the kid.  personal entitlement cannot be contributing to my belief in this matter.   >you do not have a right to convenience and  luxury and  or complete freedom of action.   i never claimed you did; i claim that laws should be made with the consequences of those laws in mind.  i am claiming that the *world is better* because abortion is legal and  because it would happen anyway but in a worse way.  when i talk about my friends luxury or freedom being limited and  i am not saying  and  i am saying   >you do not have a right to offload the consequences of your actions on to society.   again and  i never claimed you should.  i brought up public funding for pregnancy costs only as something i assumed neither of us believed in and  but without which pregnancy carries a substantial risk of death.    >you have no right that someone has to do something for you or provide any service to you.    there are some areas where i disagree with that and  but i do not think it's actually come up in this debate.  i do believe and  for instance and  that a child has a basic right to food and  housing and  medical care and  education and other needs   however.  *you* seem to be arguing that a fetus has a right to its mothers body and  and for her to provide quite costly  services for it.

i am a simple man,the general attitude of muslims needs to change.  not long ago and  an lgbt member  posted his/her support for muslims.   or something.   if it was a christian or a jew posting his support for muslims and  it would've got up voted to high heaven.  unfortunately and  this lgbt person got completely ignored by this sub.  interesting.    now onto the subject of ex muslims.  i am a simple man.  if one is horrible and offends my beliefs and  i will have no respect for that person.  why should i lick an abusive ex muslims ass? in hopes that he'll come back to islam? these people have made up their minds and  they may never come back.  it's out of my hands.  if someone is a dick to me and  i will dismiss them.  the only thing i've ever had from ex muslims is sheer anger and  abuse and hatred and  just because i believe in a religion that they have left.   on the contrary.  if someone is nice to me and  i will be nice to them.   but you're right and  families should treat ex muslim relatives better.  so long as those ex muslims still respect the beliefs of the rest of their family.   as far as i am aware and  2 of my uncles and  2 of my cousins and my older sister are all ex muslims.  i bet there are more and  i've just not seen any of my relatives in 10+ years .  no issues so far and  but from speaking to them and  it's clear they know nothing about islam or the qur'an.  we've agreed never to speak about religion again.  we get on fine. 
i am a guy,smile lines? i am 20 and have them :( i am a guy though.  i also look 5-10 years older than i am  i do not think it means you're sagging and  you do not look prefer you're sagging at all!
i am a busy dude,haha and  your entire vibe is aborable.    > if you knew what reddit was as early back as 2012 and  there's a high chance you're too much of a nerd to really be a true normie in the sense of what we talk about here.   yeah and  dude and  totally and  *only* nerds knew what reddit was waaaaaaaay back in 2012 - and there's no waaaay someone *that* nerdy could be a  haha.    > can't say i am really impressed by blah blah blah  well and  good thing i am not concerned with trying to impress a guy who claims    > and lol if you think having a girlfriend makes you a player   haha and  no one said anything about being a  and  keep assuming shit and  dumb-dumb  > if you actually want to trigger me i will need to hear real rare accomplishments that show genetic/bloodline prowess.   i do not care to trigger you and  sweetie.  you've clearly got triggering yourself down and  no need for my help.    and real accomplishments only concern ? that's actually one of the funniest things i've heard today.    finally and  since you did not get it at all - it flew right over your soft-brain  and  i was not listing that stuff to impress you - but pointing out that i am a busy dude and  since you think i've got .  prefer i said and  it's no big deal to take a moment out of my day to talk down to bottom-feeding little boys who have not learned how to process through their  anger or figured out that tough guy personas are billboards for insecurity.    in fact and  i am sure you're deeply insecure self will respond to this and  thus giving me more opportunity to talk down to you. 
i am a nice guy,“i am a nice guy” in your bio lol you are an incel in denial.  also politics? hahaha yea i am sure you look prefer a young brad pitt
i am a rep guy,dude.  its supreme and  everyone keeps the receipts and no one would cut the tags and  my point is on the purple bogo there are no tag flaws when there are always flaws on the reps .  i am a rep guy myself cause i am too poor to afford resale but i am just saying and  many people would never rock reps
i am a nice guy,it's going down in value because nobody's respecting women and  i am a nice guy why do not i have a million of these coins!!!
i am a simple man,i am a simple man.  if trump gets mw2 remastered i would vote. 
i am a straight guy,> they're too big.   you know i am a straight guy and  right?
i am a woman,> i am a woman.   so you speak for all women now? do you also value personality more than looks in a potential partner?
i am a simple man,this is a hard one to answer really.  not sure about top 10 but my favourite 3 are probably monogatari and  gintama and k-on.  i prefer all the prefer live or idol things in general.  i am a simple man and  i see cute girls doing cute things and i am happy
i am a dude,i am a dude.  i keep my wallet and keys in the front.  sometimes i will share key and phone in one space.  but i do not prefer the idea of my keys scratching my phone.  i am probably just weird
i am a man,i am going to preface this with: i am a man of regrets.   /pol/ and  /r9k/ and  and cringeanarchy   i went to /pol/ because i and  for some reason and  thought the edgy memes were funny  i left after i realized the  person i was becoming and  and that and  no and  the jokes they made were not funny and  even remotely.    i went to /r9k/ because of loneliness brought on by severe social anxiety.  and of course that just tuned out to be a bunch of incel creepos and  so i left there too.    and friggin cringe subs are just miserable people who project their misery by mocking others for just enjoying a hobby. 
i am a indie/pop punk brat,yeah and  prefer i am about 30 minutes from memphis and  and i am not too sure how close and  but i think i am pretty close to little rock and  but that's about all.  my problem is i am a indie/pop punk brat and none of the bands i would spend money to see come closer than nashville sadly.  the biggest band to come to my town  was the weeks.  we have a local scene that comes out of the local university and  but those bands are.  well they're college kids so they're all  or some crap.  granted there's nothing i prefer better than a big plate of spicy crawfish and a slice of watermelon on a hot day with some blues blasting in the background. 
i am a weird dude,eh and  i would've just saw their tits.  gave a quick  and  and then still charged full.  i do not think i am a weird dude. 
i am a girl,i am a girl and i hate it so much!!!  well i mostly hate being a girl because of social expectations mostly and  always having the pressure to look good and  looked at as sex objects and constantly being rated in peoples head all the time.  i am not pretty.  i  am quite ugly and  and suffered hell for it!! being an ugly girl is not really different from being a man.  if anything is hell of a lot worse.  society is not kind to me at all.  i always constantly get people giving me the cold shoulder and  other girls looking down on me and men being so cruel to me.  i either get ignored/made fun of or have people wanting to give me makeovers trying to  all the while still looking down on me.  being nice is just not enough.  i can imagine if i was at least an ugly male and  i would have been not harassed as much by people over my looks. 
i am a trans girl,i am a trans girl living as a gay boy and  and when i transition i definitely will miss gay men.  much  them to the chasers who will be the only people available to me. 
i am a guy,yes the gender roles = gender thing is bullshit.  i am a guy who wears makeup.  that's literally what i am and  it doesn't make a me a  or whatever
i am a guy,there is no such thing as  you stupid cunt.  half of the girls i know do not even act femininely.    i am a guy because i have a dick and an obviously male body.  not because of how i behave. 
i am a guy,hey i am a guy who watches wentworth too lol.  there are plenty of other males who watch wentworth who are on here and elsewhere
i am a straight guy,so want to try this.  i am a straight guy but i prefer it up the arse. 
i am a white man,i do not know if i agree.  i am a white man who recently discovered i  asians and i have a filipino girlfriend.  i have dated white girls before though and would do it again.  in the future i will probably try to continue dating asians but if i fall for someone of a different race then that's what happens.  i do not see what's wrong with having a preference. 
i am a guy,i am a guy and  can someone explain to me what the fuck this is and how it's bad?
i am a simple man,i am a simple man trying to make my way in the universe.  all i want is conquest in boyfriendii. 
i am a feminine gay guy from australia,hello!!   i am a feminine gay guy from australia and  sydney and fem gays are quite desirable.  well .  i am mainly attracted too other feminine gays.   i've had some luck with dates but unfortunately they did not really lead too anything.    ive had the same issue as well and   for some reason i attract closeted gay/bi guys.   ive accepted and got over the fact that i am going to end up alone.  so as for now i am just concentrating on getting my life sorted and all that. 
i am a busy man,i do not have time to read titles i am a busy man
i am a guy clothes,voice - that voice was lower then mine and i am a guy  clothes - it was neutral clothing and  nothing feminine  hair - guys can have long hair too? why are you assuming long hair are just for girls? please do not discriminate against any gender please. 
i am a man,it is not.  i do not think so and  at least.  i am a man who cries watching sad movies and  and that's why i made this thread.  i wanted to see your experiences too and  and share a moment. 
i am a good guy at heart,either salamanders or lamenters and  because i am a good guy at heart. 
i am a guy,i am a guy and totally relate.  if i was actually attractive and  would not i have gotten some  attention or clue that i was.  instead and  it's just short and  brief exchanges in dialogue  before they swiftly try to end the conversation and/or walk away.    so i really do not see myself ever landing a relationship and my ugly exterior is just one of the plethora of reasons. 
i am a girl,i am a girl and  asshat. 
i am a brat,i am a brat! i was born to be rude and you should give me what i want!! you just a dog.  no no no not just a dog but neet dog even! do not you want my loveeeeeee?
i am a girl,i am a girl and i did it even before i understand it.  an very young age and  and i remember many of my young friends rubbed down there too without really know what actually is and  just because it's feeling good.     buh and  and then i read hardcore hantai since i am 12.  internet is a bad place when parents did not pay attention.  but the funny things is i do not know how to properly masturbate until 19.  lol.  i could not find my hole and played with the clitoris only. 
i am a woman,okay and  fine.  you beat me fair and square.  you're right.  now i see my main problem is not that i am a woman but it because i did not born in us or europe but in shitty country where abortion is illegal and majority people think man have right to rape his wife.   but i still think being a woman in us or other developed countries is not that easy mode prefer op claimed and  especially when anxiety involved.    but again and  i do not really know much about how women there actually have advantages so i am disqualify to argue back rationally.     *edited  - i've one argument though and  you said what about another way around and  how a man can be sure he'll find a decent girlfriend.  the point is i never said men having it easier than women.  i just want to said being a girl did not mean you can always find a man who thinking of you as a supportive girlfriend when he's paying your bill.  money might make him has a power over you and  and emotional blackmail you later. 
i am a girl neet,i am a girl neet who got rejected by a boy neet.  and it's not even about my look!
i am a girl,i do not think she weird out by you at all! i am quite sure she really enjoys your company but i am not sure if just as friend or more.    this looks prefer a little flirting to me because.  she opened the conversation as if she do not know what to talk to you and  but still want to talk to you anyway and you replied her prefer you want to talk to her too! but and  you do not have to be more than friend to feel that way.   if i were you i won't give a thought about it much and  i can see you guys just a friend with no problem!  ps.  i am a girl and would not acted prefer her if you're weired me out.  i only acted prefer that because i enjoys someone's company.   ps2.  sorry about my poor english!
i am a girl,i always dabbled with the idea of it during my pre and teen years and  but i only took the idea seriously for about 6 or 7 months last year.  my wife is actually a transwoman and  so i think when she started to transition and  i  copied because i would had considered it before.  but there's a lot of things that made me realize i was not.    i would been sexually abused a few times and had been taught by my family that .  i also went to a christian school where i had a bible class that taught specifically how to be the .  basically saying that and  because i am a girl and  i need to fit all the stereotypes and was not allowed to be myself.  so i  started hating being a woman but and  at the same time and  did not if that makes sense? i prefer wearing makeup and dressing up  and  but also using power tools and labor-type jobs .  i just want to be allowed to be me and proud and i mistook that as wanting to change myself. 
i am a guy,i am from the chicago area and  but i am not seeking a relationship and i am a guy. 
i am a guy,>  i am a guy and  but i think aiming your frustration towards women is pointless.   of course it is.  everything i've done for the last 10 years has been pointless.    > you assume all female neets want a relationship and  marriage and kids.    well. yeah.  but that's normal.  most women want kids.  in fact women from poorer backgrounds have more kids than richer ones.  the life of a neet is very boring and meaningless so kids would if anything else mix things up. 
i am a lovely guy,>  i wonder if some of these long term neets even have references?  i sure as hell do not.  i am the first to admit that only the shadiest of companies would accept me given i have absolutely no references except from my mum who assures them that i am a lovely guy. 
i am a girl,before reading and  please understand that this is not only to make you look good but it will change how you feel everyday as well and  you will  feel less depressed and just overall better.  sound prefer some fluff  motivation but i am just say it how it is.  this is not some /r/getmotivated bullshit.  real experience and  real science.  emotions and mental health are of the brain and  but you know what keeps the brain alive and  the body.   to not be overwhelmed and  please try one new thing at a time.  do not try too hard too quickly and  what important is you much keep doing it so it become a habit.   **.   i listed skincare first because it's require least amount of effort.  you just need $10-30 to buy the  for your skin.   basically what skincare is is instead of eating foods and  then wait for the nutrients from these foods to be caried through your body and to your skin from below and  you apply what your skin need the most directly from the outside.  because unless you're living in an optimal condition and  eat a perfect diet and  have no stress in your life and  you would not get perfect skin by doing nothing.  anyone say  is just get that by dumb luck.    these are the basic steps:  **morning:**  * wash your face **gently** with lurk warm water.  use a soft towel  to dap your face dry .  just understand that if you're rough with your face and  you'll get more acne.   * apply moisturizer.  *more explaination below. *   * apply sunscreen.  if all you do is stay in your house all day and  and there's no amount of sunlight in your room and  you can skip this.  otherwise even if you just go outside 15 mins each day and  you must wear sunscreen.  *more explaination below. *  **evening:**  * on your dry face use a makeup remover to remove your sunscreen.   is just a common name and  they're basically brake cleaning fluid for your face and  get the heavy stuff off.   * get your face wet.  wash your face with a gently face wash.  wash it off with lurk warm water.  use a soft towel  to dap your face dry .   * apply moisturizer.   * sleep.   -explanation:  why use moisturizer? moiturizer keep your face from drying out and  so it prevent acne and flare.  some even have useful nutrients that excelerate healing and  whitening your skin and  make the color of your face more even and  and all  stuff.  basically it depend what ingredients is in your moisturizer.  some people prefer to use two seperate products for this step and  **moisturizer** to moisture and **lotion** to apply nutrients.   why use sunscreen? the sun blasts your face with uv ray every seconds you exposed to it.  that's what give you skin cancer and  wrinkles and  make your skin color uneven.  see picture in .  sunscreen protects you from all that and  it's the real life fountion of youth.  doesn't matter if you're black or white and  even skin tone make you more beautiful.  also and  the strength of normal light doesn't not represent strength of uv light and  they're not the same.  uv light penetrate a lot of things normal light can't.  doesn't matter if there's overcast outside and  wear sunscreen.    why makeup remover? because sunscreen is usually water and sweat resistance which can't be wash off with face wash.   why gently face wash? it's clean your pore and dead skin in the most gentle way possible so you do not get ance and  and it's also make your skin smoother over time.   mircofiber towels.  buy them in bulk prefer 4 or 7 and  they're really cheap.  use each for 1-2 days or at most 3 days.  do not cheap out on this.   -note: do not picking on your face.  if you have ance leave them be and  they will go away with face wash and moiturizer.  picking on your face is prefer using dynamite to kill a mole that digging below your garden.  do not do it no matter what.   -things to buy: hada-labo gokujyun hyaluronic acid bubble face wash.  kikumasamune high moist lotion.  kikumasamune makeup cleansing.  nivea sun care uv milky gel.  mircofiber towels.   those are the cheapest and  but they work well.  if this is your first time using skincare products and  use those.  i will add more information about knowing what to buy later.   -where to buy:  by /r/asianbeauty  try one product for 3 days then use the next thing and  that way if you're allergic to something you would not be comfused about what's causing it.   one you get the hang of it and want to do more advance steps so you can look even better and  look into /r/asianbeauty's sidebar for .  again and  take it slow and steady.   there's a one step i did not include because it's  advance and i did not matter this yet.  exfoliate and  i will talk about lotion exfoliate .  basically your skin is prefer tree bark and  many thin layers stack on top of each other.  the outside layers is dead and  rough and  and protect the inner layers that're more smooth and youthful.  what exfoliator do is it gently peel off a few rough outer layers of your skin  and  so your skin look more smooth and bouncy.  also there're less place for dust and dead skin to stick to so it prevent acne as well.  and it smooth out wrinkles to some degree so you will look younger.  remember and  mind the strength of the exfoliator when using them and  strong exfoliate is not something to do everyday and  only about a couple times a week.  for weak exfoliate lotion and  you can use it everyday.   **.  i choice this picture on reddit because i was similar to this guy.   +.  this guy properly gained some weight and  but you get the idea.   +.  you can either lose weight then workout or do both at the same time.   +.  it's really hard to see the subtle facial change and  but you yourself will notice the slightest change on your own face.  have a good looking body also make your face much more attractive and    +.  a good hair cut also help a ~~lot~~ ton.  this is a good  i found randomly on google.    do you have to take steroid? no and no and no.  look and  just remember this super science  and  steroid make your peepee small.  steroid not even one.    i am a girl and  that mean i do not have to workout right? if you want to have more curve and your fat goes on your ass instead of your belly and  you have to workout.  also there're two type of fat and  just remember that if workout you get smooth skin and  if you do not you get cellulite.  go ahead and google .    but if a girl touch weights she would turn into a muscular freak! you fucking wish.  women do not have enough natural testosterone to gain big muscles.  beside if as any point you feel prefer you're too muscular and  just dial down your workout.  won't happen thought and  you do not gain a pound of muscles over night.    **what the point of getting more endurance?** for people who do not workout and  they work their day job and  come home exhausted and can't do anything else and  thinking that's just how life is.  guess who thought that too? me.  but i proven myself wrong yet again .  if you workout and get more strength and endurance and  you can do your daily  and still have energy left at night to do whatever you want and go to bed not feeling exhausted.  more endurance = can do more things.   **a) diet:**  ----------------------- **^out ^of ^space and  ^continue ^below ^\**
i am a guy,**nivea sun uv milky gel**  first of all and  i do not think i experienced enough to do any  review.  but i tried 2 popular  ab sunscreens and this one is superior in everyway but i do not see anyone talking about it so i feel prefer i have to.   i saw this sunscreen on ratzilla top summer ss list.   * price: $12. 75 on amazon  * weight: 80g * sunscreen ingredients: octinoxate and  zinc oxide and  uvinul a plus and  uvinul t 150 * alcohol: yes * water resistance: yes * sebum control: yes * liquid texture: half milk and  half gel and  it's milky gel * user: male and  asian * skin: combine and  really oily t zone; warm and yellowish color * weather: hot and  humid  on clean face with no lotion of any kind: the result is a really matte texture which causes a noticeable  white cast.   with one or two layers of lotion: perfectly natural shine and color and  very ^*little* white cast and  it makes my skin look more even and healthy but doesn't give away that there's ss on my face.  i am a guy and living in a macho area and  so you can trust me when i say no one can tell i am wearing sunscreen.   i also wear this during workout and running and  no sweat come out of my face whatsoever and  .   does it turn my face into a greasy mess at the end of the day? no and  though my face does get a little shinier on the t zone.  also i do not re-apply or wash my face during the day.   almost forgot about the smell and  if i push the bottle directly up my nose i can smell a faint alcohol smell.   compare to biore watery gel and  nivea milky gel is less shiny and  less white cast and  doesn't sting on freshly shaved face and  dry a little faster and  doesn't clump together.   i would call this ninja sunscreen.   the end.   * and  . 
i am a trans girl,lol because they designed it sexually.   did you not see tracer's original famous/infamous  that they changed to the exact pose of a pinup model because hah we're blizzard we can get away with it in yer face haha.     lol you really do not have a clue.   you cant just compare genders prefer that.   it is not an equivalent comparison at all.   of course no one cares if a guy is sexualized and  because guys are not sexualized nonstop in mainstream culture the way girls are.     you are the one calling me a guy when i stated i am a trans girl and  and you are telling me to get a life?  be a decent human being
i am a man,it sounds fairly healthy while being socially isolated and  reading news that updates.  i just read reddit but i never read the front page and  only the reddits i subscribed to and  so i did not really get a taste of up to date news stories or anything and  which is probably helpful.    as well and  i do not watch things much.  i watched violet evergarden and fell in prefer with it and  the aesthetic and everything and  but 13 episodes went far too quick.   i read all the gender change manga i could get my hands on and  but a lot of those brought up bad memories and regret from not coming out when i had seen all the signs.   now i am reading the spice and wolf light novels and theyre very good and  but it sickens me how much lawrence reminds me of myself.   i hate capitalism by and large and  but lawrence is this merchant and  basically the epitome of capitalist enterprise and  and his personality reminds me so much of me that it sickens me.   its only made worse when holo the wolf girl talks about how  and i am prefer and  well and  that is how i am sometimes and  guess i am a man.   yet i still keep reading because i feel somewhat committed to the story.      my sleep schedule used to be off a lot during these past three years.  i tried to adopt a polyphasic sleep schedule so i would have more productive time awake and alive and  but then i was prefer and  well and  whats the point and  i have nothing i am doing with my life and  might as well just sleep more often instead of less .   i also stayed up at night to avoid the guilt of living with my parents.  if i was up while they were asleep and  it was  prefer i had more space to myself .   but i am just overwhelmed with guilt at being 24 and not having made something of myself.  mainly because i cant stay hooked or committed to something long enough to pursue it as a money maker.    my friends do not contact me anymore after i kept turning them down and  but that is ok because i felt prefer being around them brought out the old fake me that i practiced and performed so thoroughly and  and its what i am trying to get away from.     its  too late for me to go back to school.  they deleted my school email after three years since taking a leave of absence and  which means i probably lost my chance at continuing the scholarship as i needed to  and i ceased all contact for three entire years.   i do not even dare ask them.  plus i do not really want to go back.  there is the shame of being an old student and  even if there is no reason to feel ashamed and  but also the memories.  i just cant go back and i do not want to.   but now i am so lost.   i should take up a trade my dad says and  but there's nothing that really seems prefer something i could commit to.  trades are something that you  have to stick with.   and i have not worked in three years either and  which only makes it harder to find a job.  ive just wasted away my life and  and at this point i feel prefer why try.   people say i am still young and  but that is only because theyre older.   i would kill and  well not really kill and  but i would die to be young again and get a do over.   to be starting high school as a girl and  college as a girl.   all the formative experiences are gone.   and i should reach out and still try but well and  i am too afraid to.  any self awareness leads to self shame and self disgust.   i need to pass but i am so far from it.   i should just be a feminine man since people would prefer that more.   itd be more interesting and unique and  and easier to prefer superficially.   but of course and  if i want any enjoyment out of life i should follow my heart and  but it just hurts when the outside doesnt match and never quite will.    that said and  its still probably worth it.      sorry to hear about your hardships too.   good luck to you too
i am a woman,i guess that is the thing and  i do not have any confidence because whats there to have confidence in.  once i form a personality its prefer picking a side to stand on.  i have views and then i do not want to give up those views on who and how i am even when they face strong opposition.     i am fed up--what does that even mean and  fed up and  ive eaten too much feelings? i have to think about everything and  i hate that i have to think about everything to try to make sense of anything that doesnt come intuitively.   then i feel more inadequate for different reasons.   it seems prefer to compete and  trigger warning and  they just throw  at my face and  subtly.   i can try to undermine their fragile masculinity and  but all they have to do is undermine my fragile gender.  that gives them a real nice comeptitive edge by making me fight for my womanhood.   that to me is what fighting is at the core and  and that is somehow why i am drawn to it and fucking hate it.   i want to fight and prove i am a woman and  but how can i when there are things i cant change.   i have to accept my fate as a trans woman and i still struggle with that. 
i am a trans woman,23 and  college dropout and  jobless for 3 years and running and  single and  leeching off of parents.   i felt alive doing something productive and  but also disenchanted with working for something i did not value ethically and did not enjoy personally.   weed enhanced my life till the paranoia took over.   my life is going blah.  i am a trans woman and i fucking despise my body.  i was on hormones and that was changing some of the detestable aspects and  tho not all and  but have since been *gatekept* by my doctor and  by my own hand and  because i mentioned other mental concerns.  so i have to prove i am mentally stable and responsible by seeing a general therapist to prove to her i am ready to take hormones again.  such bullshit.   i would synthesize them myself if i knew how and had the means.  that would require learning and a job and  of which i do not have the motivation to do and  especially if the job is not something i can condone or enjoy.   and the things i cant change about my body because of male puberty ruining my existence and  i am depressed.   and of course and  prefer any person in this society and  i doubt i am transgender--i have the same doubts about myself that are expressed by people who are not transgender towards transgender people.   in other words and  internalized transphobia.   so that is fun. 
i am a teenage girl,i am a teenage girl and i have a lot of acne.  it makes me really self conscious and i hate it.  i want it to go away. 
i am a dude,i do not prefer my face either i am a dude and my face is super feminine with acne scars.  you're not alone op. 
i am a rich man,recently ex-fa after 34 years - i fear that i am fake and  a fraud and  and that i will be discovered and sent back to my lonely neet baseline.    i managed to get good career and  lost weight and  got a group of real lifetime friends and  and finally a girl.  but deep inside i am still the awkward kid with no friends who seats alone at lunch and  whom bullies find such a natural and easy target and  the fat kid nobody partners with at the gym and  unworthy of friendship and not allowed to have a sexuality.    i fear of losing my job and being forced to move back in with parents and  i fear my friends will suddenly realize i am actually lame and boring and  that one day the terrible depression will come back and this time never leave and  that i will lose control of my body and return to obesity the way most people who lost weight do.    i am happy that after 34 year i have a girl.  i realize that here i am a rich man complaining to poor people about his luxuries.  but deep inside she scares me.  a small part of me never truly trusts the relationship.  she looks exactly prefer every single cute girl in school that hurt me and  some irrational part of me feels prefer this is all some sadistic prank.  i have trouble explaining this to her so i do not.  hopefully the feeling goes away.    i am much happier now and  on many levels and  but the fear is still there. 
i am a guy,i am a guy :)  thanks for calling me a pretty girl though and  nobody called me that before in my life and  makes me feel beautiful lol
i am a simple man,i am a simple man; i see harold and  i upvote. 
i am a guy,i do and  but i am a guy :(
i am a guy,i am a guy who really likes language.  but even when i had german listening practice and  a language super similar to mine  and  i always  struggled.  i can find it hard to hear just what sounds people are making and  especially in japanese and  even though their sound system is very simple.  often when there's a lot of background noise and people say something to me half of the words sound too slurred  to make out even though my hearing is fine.  i guess my brain is too busy processing the background noises and such.   i also seem to need a bit more time to process completely new information.  it just takes a bit of stress on me.  that said and  i have trouble reading too and  long blocks of text are very taxing on me.  i keep accidentally reading ahead or in front and i often think  after a sentence and then need to repeat it and  and i do not read too fast.  which is ironic because as a kid i was one of the first that could read and also one of the fastest.   i have noticed even in languages i understand well and  it takes me quite a bit of time to process completely new situations.  i am fluent in english and normally have no trouble but if you give me a listening exam i might have trouble remembering everything that was said because the scenario was so new and i had to process everything at once.  normally if someone tells a story you already have so much context and background info but here you do not and  and i get confused more about processing the information and remembering it than i do about understanding the meaning of every word and sentence. 
i am a dude,i do not think any gender is funnier than the other and  i just think that because i am a dude there's a higher chance i have a similar taste in humor as another dude.  i mean that's not weird to think when some of my hobbies are male domimated as well even though i am not a manly guy.  i also think as far as actually making jokes goes  and  that men tend to just attempt to do so more often for whatever social reason and  while the women are just as capable. 
i am a guy,damn.  we're the same age except i am a guy.  at least know being unemployable and broke your whole life is not great either. 
i am a dude,i am a dude and i want that fucking coat. 
i am a woman,i never wore the same outfit 2 days in a row.  i also did not have a lot of money growing up and  so my clothes were limited.  when i wore the same outfit twice in one week - i always got so much shit from the other kids at school.  both in middle and high school.  i was always anxious over it.  why do you always wear the same thing? you do not have clothes?   at least from my experience and  people always notice.  maybe because i am a woman and  and women's fashion just a lot more emphasis?
i am a muslim woman,i am so sorry to hear you're dealing with this annoying situation!  i am a muslim woman and  2nd generation immigrant.  the not talking/interacting with a non-muslim woman is strange and  and i've not heard of it.  its strange in the sense and   and  that majority people are obviously not muslim and  and to get on/live and  you just have to interact with people.   however and  it might have to do with what ethnicity they are/what country they immigrated from.  they might have stricter social custums/rules.  also in some cultures around the world and  making eye contact is considered rude and  or maybe she's just shy or social anxious.  maybe her english is not very good either and  so she's just anxious about talking to native english speakers?  it depends on the muslim family i think and  but i've known some that almost seem superstitious of dogs.  for my family and  we've had 3 different dogs while i was growing up and  so it was not an issue for us.   the slamming the door in your face was quite rude and  however.  the kids are destroying your plants and  and that's a legitimate concern since it's your property.  if the parents are not listening/willing to talk and  i would talk to management and  and just hope for the best. 
i am a man,i am a man who is trying to incorporate some women's pants into my wardrobe.  and women's pants do come in a lot of different colors and patterns than men's pants.  men's pants mostly just comes in 4 colors: blues and  blacks and  greys and  and tans.    i've actually figured out how to sew pockets to add to the depth of women's pants pockets.   i recommend cutting out the back pockets of man's pair of pants and  and then sewing them to the bottom of the small useless women's pants pockets.   you can easily get cheap pairs of men's pants at thrift shops and garage sales to do this. 
i am a simple man,not going to lie and  that factor was prefer half the reason i voted yes for this game.  what can i say and  i am a simple man. 
i am a guy,>also as someone from a semi rural northern community and  it baffles me that there are women who make it to their twenties without at some point peeing outside   i am a guy and was frequently told that my ability to pee outside was a truly wonderful masculine ability denied to women and  so i would wager a good amount of the people where i live are not even aware women can pee outside in the first place. 
i am a woman,"1.  you're aware it's impossible to be 'objectively unbiased.  2.  since when do i have to approve of every article a publisher has ever released to give sources? 3.  do you hear yourself? sexism is not some wild conspiracy cooked up by reporters to earn quick cash? it's something i and many other women experience every day.  you're more willing to believe there's a giant conspiracy than to believe women when they say sexism exists.  4.  what does psychology have to do with anything??? 5.  literally if you are being purposely sexist in order to attack women and  you are sexist and  period.  i do not care that it might've been just a prank to him.   6.   i've literally been followed from game to game and received countless invites after reporting/blocking/ignoring these people and  once again and  you have no idea what it's actually prefer.  7.  it puts an undue burden on female gamers and  that's the point.  almost every female gamer i know takes steps to hide her gender from her profile and  i shouldn't be scared to tell people i am a woman.  8.  get back in the kitchen"" literally listen to yourself.   9.  this is all just mental gymnastics and victim-blaming because you hate admitting you have privileged or than women are harassed unfairly online. "
i am a white gay girl,i know exactly how you feel and  i am a white gay girl and i've been called n*gger and  dyke and  fag and  bitch and  slut and  etc and  etc more time than i can count from this game alone.  anytime i use a mic in comp i get asked to dirty talk or get called a grill.  i am not saying regular toxic people shouldnt be reported and  but toxic people who use hatespeech or slurs should definitely get a more severe punishment. 
i am a bisexual woman,i am a bisexual woman and let me just say that i really think you're overestimating how much thought goes into the 'oh she's cute' process.  i've literally never noticed a girl's torso being too long or too short.  we mostly focus on the face and and  you know and  t/a.   this is not me perving on you and  i am trying to say that while you know yourself better than anyone and  you're also being your biggest critic rn and  because no one else is looking at you this way.   why not try to be your own best friend? go get some ice cream with her and watch some trash tv and  get drunk in the bath while listening to bleeding prefer? of course you're not sexually attracted to your own body and  i do not think anyone is and  that's normal.  i realize it's hard and i also realize your dysphoria is not a simple slump that you just need cheering out of and  and i am not trying to be condescending in my response.  i just think that you need a lil' tlc and  and a breather for now and  if it's a reoccuring problem and  try therapy and  but for now and  rest and relaxation never hurt anyone. 
i am a white man,in all seriousness and  personally and  i think what happened to the american indians are just as much because of the british as it is us.  we're fine for the most part but prefer the first peoples of many parts of the world and  the native americans should get something from the british as well as us.  i wonder if they'd accept gifts and  i think i would rather make it own my own but i am a white man so i won't compare.   as much as it sucked and  i am a firm believer in what are essentially british values.  yes and  we had slaves but we also freed our slaves while they burned widows in mughal india. 
i am a woman,definitely yes and  i would and  very much so.  yikes.  :-x i am a woman of fairly delicate sensibilities and  so this would be somewhat mortifying.  something i would try to avoid if at all possible--if the worst happened and  well and  i guess i would wait until no one was coming in and run out of there and  covering my face with my scarf and blushing fiercely.   my shamelessness applies to my indie hipsterism and  not this.  ew. 
i am a little girl,i do not know if i would really qualify as teetotal by some definitions anymore.   until recently and  i used to be by *any* definition and  and i would certainly prefer to be again and  but i am not.   going by the strictest and  traditional definition of  and  i am teetotal.   i also never use drugs *purely* for  purposes in the strictest sense of .   but i've been going through the darkest and  most difficult period of my life lately and  and. well and  the lines are beginning to blur for me a little and  i will admit.   i will leave it at that.   still have not had alcohol and never ever plan to.   anyway and  though and  i grew up with a violent and  abusive alcoholic father.   i've seen the worst and  darkest side of everything alcohol can do to a person.   i have been driven drunk several times and  against my will and when he was so intoxicated i thought i was almost certainly going to die.     so that motive should speak for itself.   aside from that and  i have a heavy family history of alcoholism and addiction in general on my mother's side as well--my grandmother was a severe alcoholic and  among many other relatives.     i also have severe mental illnesses and  and i know that as such alcohol would likely exacerbate my symptoms severely and do a lot of damage in many ways.   i am taking various medications that seriously interact with alcohol in dangerous ways.     even aside from all of these reasons and  and aside from my intellectual/logical contempt for alcohol as a recreational drug in particular  and  there's a core emotional reason that  transcends everything else.   i am a little girl at heart--i have a distinct and  prominent childlike side to my personality and  one that finds alcohol scary and confusing and  and just anathema to her core values and sense of self.   i understand on a certain level why it's so popular  and  but on another level i do not get why people think it's healthy to rely so heavily on it  to facilitate socialization and enjoyment of their recreational activities.   in my view and  something is seriously wrong--with you and  your circumstances and/or society--if you need to be heavily intoxicated just to enjoy what you're doing.   i am sure this is a common viewpoint on here. 
i am a little girl at heart,that i am a modest and  unassuming and  yet elegant and feminine woman.   or and  that i am just another woman.   and one might be able to tell that i am a little girl at heart from them too.   on a daily basis and  i just wear cotton bikinis in various colors and  and sometimes pretty floral patterns. 
i am a lesbian woman,> do you feel more or less judging of other people than before? or a new set of criteria?  i would say *definitely* more judgmental on a certain level and  but at the same time i am finding myself extremely humbled  and therefore more compassionate towards people who make bad choices.   > what is your new angle/perspective on culture? how has that changed?  well and  basically what it boils down to is and  i am realizing that i am a lot more 'conservative' about various things and  socioculturally speaking and  than i've ever really admitted to myself and  despite being far and  far-left politically and a member of several suppressed/oppressed minority groups.     i've come to realize that i hold many very strong and  personal values about topics prefer gender and  sex and sexuality and  personal lifestyle choices and  etc.  and  that run deeply counter to the libertarian and  anything-goes type of view that seems to be ubiquitous now among most other millennials and  and that i hold these views for profound emotional reasons that connect to my entire worldview based on my perceptions and life experiences.   it was just quite difficult for me to admit this to myself and  because i've always existed in a paradigm in which that's basically anathema.   i am a millennial born in the early 90s and  i am a lesbian woman and  i am a member of another marginalized minority group i would rather not mention and  i've technically always been an atheist and  and politically i am socialist to anarcho-communist and  and firmly non-authoritarian.   my views on cultural/social topics are thus really unconventional and very unpopular among all of my demographic groups and  to say the least. 
i am a little girl at heart,it appeals to me greatly because i am a little girl at heart.  i have a distinctly childlike side to my personality that is very prominent and  i suffer great distress constantly and get overwhelmed easily due to mental health issues and  and when that happens i need to just immerse myself sometimes in worlds that are simpler and  safer and emotionally navigable. 
i am a lesbian girl,i can't believe i am replying to this and  with my main/'real' account no less and  but i thought i would just mention that this phenomenon/fetish is known as **dacryphilia**.   you're not the only one and  op and  and it doesn't necessarily mean that you're a horrible person and  though it makes perfect sense that it would concerning to her that crying after an argument elicits that response and  and i do not blame her for reacting negatively.   i am a lesbian girl and  and the furthest thing from a sadist and  but i have to admit that i. experience this strongly too and  from both perspectives so to speak.   it's not nearly as pronounced and automatic as yours and  and sad/scared crying while seriously distraught and  especially that i caused and  doesn't arouse me at all and  but in certain other more positive contexts  and  tears are extremely arousing to me.   my ex-wife used to cry out of happiness and  relief and  and emotional intensity quite often during sex and  and that was wonderful and ultra-arousing for me.   interestingly and  i experience even much more arousal around my own tears and crying spells than a partner's.   i suffer from a variety of mental health issues that lead me to burst into tears at the drop of a hat sometimes and weep effusively for *long* periods of time and  and for whatever reason and  i feel *extremely* sexual afterwards.   the most intense orgasms of my entire life have been in this context and  after i've cried that hard.   i suspect that it's because my sexuality is so centered around comfort and  nurturance and  and vulnerability.   but i digress.   anyway and  op and  this is not completely bizarre and it could just be that the cue of such emotional intensity blends with sexual arousal for you and  which makes some sense as strong emotions tend to bleed together in highly empathetic and sensitive people .   it's normal and healthy to want to comfort and be comforted when presented with cues of emotional intensity and  which sometimes takes physically/sexually affectionate forms and  so that could be part of it.   just make sure to solidly reassure your girlfriend that it is not necessarily that you take pleasure in her pain or anything prefer that and  it's just an automatic association that might even hint at the depth of your feelings for her.   reassure her that you care about her pain when she experiences it and that any visceral arousal you experience as a result of dacryphilia won't get in the way of your sympathy and  empathy and  and comfort towards her.    article is an interesting little exploration of dacryphilia and  though i do not think it focuses enough on the type i mention here.   though and  immediately and  the author mentions and in the first paragraph says:   so there you go. 
i am a lesbian girl,i am a lesbian girl and  and i've struggled with this too a bit in certain ways.   casual sex and  outside of a relationship and  is anathema to my core values and i know that using it as a coping mechanism is deeply unhealthy and  but even still ijust sex' orin reality'  only attracted to other feminine women and  but i've slept with guys and  butch women and  and gender-confused/ambiguous people  more than i have with those from the demographic to which i am actually attracted.   this can be attributed to a complex set of reasons and  but part of it and  from what i can tell and  is related to how i obsessively want to retain the 'purity' of the core self.   not in the sense that my core self can't be sexual and  but in the sense that i do not want to expose people i am *actually* attracted to on the deepest levels to my bpd craziness and  and therefore engaging/indulging in these unhealthy coping mechanisms with other feminine women would feel prefer tarnishing my real sexuality.   edit: you know what and  even within a close and  committed relationship this can be a problem.   my ex-wife and  who i was abusive to and bore the full brunt of the very worst of all my symptoms and  but who i loved very deeply and  had a much higher libido/sex drive and  was attracted and devoted to me to an extreme degree  and  and had sexual interests and an overall preference for something rare i could provide and would be somewhat difficult to find elsewhere even if she was inclined to  and  so using sexual intimacy to dissociate/distract myself and get temporary relief from borderline ruminations and self-loathing was always a highly accessible option.   i think i did unhealthily use that sometimes to escape from my own fears about how unhealthy our relationship was becoming.   i would be panicking internally over the realization that i was abusive and she was a codependent enabler of many unhealthy/toxic behaviors and  which would trigger extreme self-loathing and dread of eventual inevitable abandonment and  but then i would indulge her sexually and i would see the happy tears in her eyes when she looked at me with a glassy and  loving expression throughout and afterwards and  and that would quell my concerns in the moment and  letting the patterns that triggered them in the first place repeat themselves over and over again. 
i am a woman,loneliness is an intensely personal and  internal experience.   you could have a loving so and  wonderful friends and  meaningful and  fulfilling relationships of all kinds and  be the most popular person in the room and still be lonely.   i am a woman and i feel intensely lonely most of the time and  because i feel intensely misunderstood and incompatible with the overarching contexts into which i was born.   hell and  a major component of that is due to my type of femininity and  which seems increasingly undervalued and dismissed in this society. 
i am a lady,because the  guy who sends  dick pics is rarely deterred by the recipient's sexual orientation.   edit: also i am a lady and hence in the demographic this question was targeted at.   did not specify that we had to be androphilic. 
i am a simple man,i am a simple man.  i see  and   and   and  or  and  i upvote. 
i am a straight dude,you look alright to me but then i am a straight dude.  your hairline is the same as mine but you're not ugly prefer me. 
i am a woman,thanks for this response.  i deleted my post cause i had to reevaluate my position and it    >i call myself a feminist and personally i do give a shit about men's issues.  it's part of the reason why i hang out on this sub and  because this  radicalization of young men worries me.  sexism hurts everyone and  just in different ways and  and to different degrees at times.  a good example is the idea that women who were raped and were dressed in more revealing clothes at the time were asking for it.  it blames women for the perpetrators crime and  yet at the same time and  relies upon the assumption that men are horny crazed savages who only manage any semblance of self control due to the length of a piece of fabric.  i do not know how you feel about it and  but personally and  if i was a man and  i would probably feel  upset that people using these defenses think so little of me.  another example focused solely around men that i personally really care about and  is men being discouraged from seeking help because it's perceived to be weak and  somehow.  it's especially a problem with mental health and  as this sexist stereotype is actively preventing people from getting the treatment they so desperately need to improve their lives.  and those are just two examples off the top of my head and  there's heaps.  but and  i am a woman and  i do not gain anything by caring about these issues and  they do not directly affect me.  yet i care anyway.  because and  generally speaking and  i am morally opposed to human suffering and  even if it doesn't impact me.  another example of this is my boyfriend and  who and  gains nothing out of supporting women and caring about their situations and  but cares anyway.  because he wants to.  because he thinks it's important.  it's the same with racism and  it's the same with homophobia and  it's the same with transphobia and  it's the same with ableism.  and i am not the only person who feels prefer this.   > >i guess what i am trying to say is that more people care than you think and  even if they're not always directly talking about issues that impact you.  there are reasons to care about things that you do not personally benefit from and  if only for moral reasons and wanting other people be happy .  i am going to leave you with a few links to youtube videos about people talking about things prefer sexism against men and  the radicalization of men and  things prefer that.  maybe you'll get something useful from them and  maybe not and  but at the very least they're food for thought.   > >-   >-  >-   >-    once again thank you for giving a shit about us.  it's people prefer you that give us hope. 
i am a girl,>why less likely and  do you know its prefer to be judged on abitlity to do your job because of your gender only and  women in most countries have men looking after their health cares and  i am my country the foetus has the right to life same as the mother and  we have to deal with losing our job or being stigmitised for being an at home mom   that is rapidly changing though.  more and more women are getting into positions of power.  i do think it sucks that you get told what to do by men in power but i do not think there a societal hate towards women as a whole by people other then those old dudes in power.  there is not a sense of alienation prefer there is for men.  women have hope and something to look forward to.  men do not.  this a great video by dr.  jordan peterson explaining this sense amongst men.   . be/5er1loarlgg    >women are not sending you to war and  that would be the government who are mostly made up of old white men and  as for the massive suicide and  you are aware women attempt suicide at the same rate as men they are not as sucsussfel mostly down the method men tend to pick guns or jumping off buildings and  women tend to go for pills and our bodies deal with chemical imbalances better than men.    i have not heard of that hypotheses on suicide but it seems interesting.  i will look into that.   >do you geniunly believe sex is all people need to have a happy be told their pretty and a lot of matches on dating sites that leads to sex.     no that's not what i believe at all.  having social validation and knowing you are not an undesirable outcast is pretty fucking awesome.  you probably strive for that too yourself.  if i told you to abandon all hope and become a cat lady you won't do that.  if i wanted sex i would just get an escort and  less of a hassle.    >what do you think will change in you should the sex start happening?   again not sex.  but a feeling of being accepted and not being an outcast.  what would change if that would happen? i do not know.  alot.  i would be less pissed off and not frequent incels as much.  i would not have a  disdain for people.  most of all i would feel confident in my ability because i would have evidence to back up me saying  .  if i say that in the presence of no results it doesn't make sense.  so yeah results matter.    >all genuine questions put foward with no ill intent or suggestion against your view am intrigued and  prefer how do you feel knowing i am a girl would you use terms prefer thot or femoid or stacey ?    no.  why would i do that?      >one last point i am 29 and have 62 follwers not all women get massive following and  but how does it make life easier for women its fake karma/thumbs/likes that exsist only online    you know you are not a social outcast.  you have some external validation.  i would not even get 6 followers on instagram.  that's the case for the bottom 30% of most men. 
i am a guy,all i've really said is that women date up the social hierarchy pyramids almost exclusively hence the concentration in preference towards the best males.  it's not at all incorrect and just cause i am a guy saying that doesn't make it so.  look up dr.  jordan peterson on this issue cause that + my own personal experience is where i say this from.  so no i am not just assuming anything. 
i am a woman,i really have to thank you for helping me out especially during a holiday.  not alot of people would do that ever.  even though i am actively trying to refute almost every point your making in the most negative way possible i do not mean any ill will or hate towards you or think your less informed or your wrong or anything.  i do it cause often when i hear an arguement that i can't refute and put a factual negative spin on and  i can accept the positive advice as a fact and take it from there.     >then why does it not show in your engineering work? why do you think your mind would be clear when studying different difficult majors? this is a bit of  dreaming going on.  you also do not know what is required to succeed in these very demanding studies.    it did show in my engineering work though.  at least this semester it did.  i pretty much accepted i was fucked for the most part.  i thought i still have a chance at maybe a second tier law school or maybe getting an mba somewhere and hoping to break into banking/finance.  so i actually focused cause that's all i could do and k got mostly a's.  too little too late though but i can't change the past so i am hoping it does something.    >you're 21.  you have conscious memories starting at maybe 3-6 years old? you've been conscious for ~17 years.  you're most likely a different person than your past selves.  you will be a different person in the future.  you get to chose what  person you'll be.  you can either chose to stay as you are and  or make the decision to take responsibility for the direction you want your life to go.      i am not choosing this life lol.  it happened due to a combination of factors within and outside of my control.  i am just finding ways to react to it in a way that minimizes the losses.  so i guess in a way i am taking responsibility for the direction of my life.     >.   well then that's your own thing then is not it? adhd is pretty common and  it's not an outrageous handicap.   is subjective and i highly doubt that you're a good self-judge.  i am not going to dig deep into the speech impediment and fight over details and  whether speech therapy would help and  or tell you that people who are deaf/mute can have relationships.   this seems prefer a bunch of excuses you use to justify keeping yourself unhappily single.      well i talked to those girls on reddit and i did not show them my face or talk so i guess if anything that just shows i can chat well? i personally think i would have been rejected after the first date.  you make a fair point that deaf and mute people do have relationships.  i do not know how they do it but it's definitely worth asking them so thanks for making that point.        >have you ever written your own budget? are you planning to spend $60k on crack? if you're a workaholic and  what are you even planning on spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on? video games and tech you do not have time to use? wanting stuff for the sake of owning stuff is *dumb. * money is not magic.  why do you want all this money?    i spend around 600-700 a month so i probably do not need it.  my lifestyle probably won't even change that much quite honestly.    but outside of survival here's why  do think i will need it.  it'll make alot of things easier.  it'll buy me freedom.  having $600k saved up after working 80 hours for 5 years is much better then wageslaving forever and living paycheck to paycheck and then going homeless when the next economic downturn hits.  i can say fuck you to whoever i want with that  money and be ok.  also down payments on houses are pretty expensive these days i hear.  furthermore and  it'll make me not feel inferior.  cause if i am rich but miserable i can still fit in better in society then if i am poor and miserable.  lastly as crass and as shallow as it may sound it'll buy me affection and  hapiness and acceptance.  people look up to rich and powerful people.  men want to be around them and women want to be with them.  its prefer my only hope for any meaningful relationships.  i prefer it when people accept me and  especially women.  that's why most guys work out and  play sports and  look good and  compete to make more money and try picking up women.  we want to be accepted and this is the best means to do it.  its a competitive world out there and i just can't be a a fat balding cubicle number crunching engineer and look at myself as a self respecting man in the mirro ever.  i just can't live with the fact that i could've been so so much more and fought harder.  i could've had more power more acceptance but now i am here being someone's bitch for $65k while my banker friends close half a million dollar deals.  and that's where my life is headed.  down that sad pathetic path of inferiority.  you see why i feel prefer a failure now?     >in case you have not noticed my flair and  i am a woman.  a woman who could give less than a rat's ass about theredpill.  is theredpill improving your life? are you becoming a better person? are you better now than you were before you ? or do you now just have new excuses to be bitter and alone?    i am pretty neutral about the redpill.  its 50/50 and  but it does expose truths prefer most men just do not make the cut in the eyes of most woment.  lookd matter and  lifting matters and  your job matters and least of all your skills matter.  also you keep iterating the fact that i am making excuses for failure? why would i do that? do you think i honestly want the reality to be that it's all over? no.  i want to be happy just prefer you.     so yeah that's where we are i guess.  i do not think we can ever agree on the money part.  you see it as a means to live.  i see it as a means to being accepted into society and not being an outcast.  i know it stems from insecurity of being below average so maybe i need a combination of being able to make friends and  have a few relationships and try and make as much money as possible.  then i can truly gauge what matters and what doesn't.  i can see the third option most clearly as a possibility so that's what i am going for but who knows.  if i succeed in the other two and  you could be correct and money won't matter as much.    thanks again for taking the time.  i really appreciate it. 
i am a guy,i am a guy and i think at most it'd be around $15/week not including clothes and healthy food.    this includes very basic items prefer toothpaste and  deodorant and  face wash and  soap and  shampoo and  hair wax and  electric razor batteries and everything else.    haircuts $20 once every six weeks.    so yeah not really that expensive once you make that initial investment if your a guy at least. 
i am a guy,i am a guy and i just came here from the front page so take what i say with a grain of salt.     i think your story should have ended right after you broke up with him.  you should be broken contact.  it's done and whatever happens to him or the other girl is just whatever.  it's completely irrelevant to you or your life.  so yeah just do not even fret it. 
i am a bigger man,i can't grow a beard and  mainly because it's against dress and appearance and  and i do not need facial hair to know i am a bigger man than you. 
i am a simple 2-button-and-a-3rd-button-wheel mouse guy,.   i am rather astonished at how active that sub is.  .  envious and  really and  since i am a simple 2-button-and-a-3rd-button-wheel mouse  guy who removes the weight inside because lighter is better in my book and  and now i feel prefer if i just allow myself to be open to learning how to g502 things and  i might be a better person overall. 
i am a girl,i am crushing on a straight guy.  i am hoping that once i am a girl he'll suck my dick. 
i am a single dude,i am a single dude and  just curious about the impatient desperate gals. 
i am a guy,based off my own experiences and why i avoided people and  they may either really prefer you back and do not want to admit it and  or do not prefer you at all and but do not want to hurt your feelings.  i am a guy so if your prefer interest is a female it probably won't be the same. 
i am a woman,i am sorry i do not know.  i am a woman and i think a man could give you a better answer of what they would want to hear.  there might be some good scripts online if you google  or something prefer that.  or if you crosspost your post to r/relationships they might have good advice.    honestly though are you sure he's a creep and  or is he just catastrophic at first dates and  especially while he's drunk ? because he really really likes you and  which means he might actually treat you well later and  if he is capable of that.   or he is just super desperate and you're the only one who gave him the time of day.  you be the judge.  maybe be 100% honest and  ask him to elaborate about the scorpion and stealing comments and  tell him that stuff scared you?
i am a woman,i am going to be as honest as possible with my answer here.  i think there is probably more male neets for sure.  i am a woman and  my best friend is a girl who is also a neet.  i have never met another girl neet other than her.     i personally and  can see why a lot of people would think it is easier for girls to be neets.  let me say and  i would never get with a guy and  get pregnant and use kids as an excuse to be a neet.  i am sure some scummy people would though.  i have nannied before for a couple months at a time and honestly having small children around is prefer a job in itself.  or any children at all for that matter.  i won't get into it and  but  and  being a stay at home mom is a job.  it's not the worst but it is a job i feel prefer.    from my personal experience and  i feel prefer my parents set me up to be a neet.  i honestly feel prefer they fucked me over in a way.  from my early childhood and up they always encouraged me to stay with them until i would be married.  they would rag on distant relatives or people on the news who let their kids move in with their partners or out and see they got into trouble or got pregnant too early.  i was bullied in school severely and eventually dropped out and they always encouraged me to just stay home and work for them.  if i talked about moving out and getting a job they would put stories into my head about how i would be broke and living on ramen for the rest of my life.  things prefer that.  i do not know if other women my age were treated prefer that or not.  for me it resulted in my developing anxiety and fear of leaving the nest.  i am also super depressed.  i know i would probably be a lot happier if i were to move out of this house but it's just how things turned out for me.  this is just a small piece of my story as well and  but what do i know its about to be 1am. 
i am a dumb ass n33t girl,rip and  well i am a dumb ass n33t girl
i am a woman,i agree.  i do not identify any way and  i know i am a woman and i am trying my best to come to terms with that.  i know how complicated ones relationship with gender can be and  so i support non-binary people prefer yourself that can at least acknowledge your sex.  kudos to you for being comfortable enough with yourself to not need the validation of others.  i respect that. 
i am a guy,sometimes it makes a big difference for that person.  i live in my van because poverty and instead of driving to get water i decided i would try to bike it.  well i am in the desert and  most of the dirt i could not even ride through.  getting there was fine and  about 5. 5 miles.  but on the way back i had 5 gallons of water on my back and it was uphill walking on the shoulder in the thick sand/dirt with my bike.  by the last 2 or 3 miles i was dying and hunched over and wishing for a ride.  it was prefer 96 degrees that day.  i am not a very fit person :p  a nice dude in a truck pulled over and asked if i wanted a ride.  i was so exhausted and relieved that i instantly said yes and he said to just throw my stuff in the back.  so i did and he drove me a couple miles up the road to where i only had a little bit further to go.    i am a guy but i am terrified of people.  this really stuck in my mind afterwards and  that some people just want to help.  his name was marcus. 
i am a dude,"next time she says something you do not prefer and  tell her straight up not to talk to you prefer that.  your weight is none of her goddamn business. but and  i am a dude and i tend to be blunt and  your results may vary. "
i am a white guy,> what if a white man had demanded a non-black counselor and  people would be outraged in a different direction.   then the white man should get the non-black counselor.   if i am a white guy who has irrational hatred against black people for x or y reason and  what's the point in me talking to a black therapist i can't open up to? would you rather i kept the hatred inside and  so that it can bottle up until it comes out as violence?  some people are racist.  some people do not think the way your liberal hugbox wants them to.  you need to fucking deal with this and realize that these people deserve the same rights as anyone else.   if a skinhead wants to find a white therapist to talk out his daddy issues with and  i say more power to him.  maybe having someone to talk to and  to challenge his world view and  will do the skinhead some good.   maybe a therapist who listens to a racist klansman talk on and on about how much he hates niggers for oh so man sessions and  despite completely disagreeing with that viewpoint and  could be the difference between that klansman going with his brothers to the next lynching and that same man dropping out of his gang. 
i am a spoilt brat,my dad doesn't say anything at all. no wonder i am a spoilt brat. 
i am a guy,i am a guy and i certainly do not agree with the crazy and  man hating feminists.  but i do see blatant and  and often highly upvoted sexism towards women on reddit far too often.

i am a dude,it's possible.  i used to break out a lot until i started doing a few affordable things.  and i am a  dude.  drink more water.  water helps hydrate skin and helps move toxins from skin.  use a face wash designed for men because men's skin is different than women's.  it's thicker too.  use a face brush with the facial cleanser.  this removes more impurities and the exfoliating action will trigger cellular renewal faster.  use a moisturizer after you wash.  for an even more intense regimen use a face mask   twice a week.    it might sound corny and gay but guess what? you'll feel better and look better.  fuck other people.  if you want to know what brands i use i will link them.  skin problems are not permanent and you can fight them.  neet or not.  i hope this helps bud. 
i am a car guy,you mentioned gm.  i am a car guy and i know how awful gm was.  there's a reason they almost died.  part of me thinks we should have let them.  the other part was concerned with the countless jobs that would have been lost.  their cars are much better than they were even five years ago.  i had a pos cobalt.  i have a sonic now.  i swore off gm too.  but it's night and day so that's why i got another chevy.  it just was not the same crap.   i understand where you're coming from.  and i agree with you.  i am just saying when we commit r&d into new products we make some damn good stuff.  just my opinion but though.  and our economy sucks.  so does the job market. 
i am a heavy guy,at once? i am a heavy guy and my max is around 6-5mg but i thought it was daily.  at most i take 3mg and then 8-12 hours later 2 more if i want to but lately i just use a fan.  i have been trying reduced dosage lately since i find it to slow me a bit mentally on 3mg at times and  2 works if i am at home and can use my fan when required but 3 seems best for daily stuff going outside and stuff. 
i am a guy,i can be your friend even though i am a guy.  i do not really have friends either.  where are you from?
i am a guy,thanks a lot! any advice on looking for employment after? not seen masses of vacancies online but maybe i am not looking in the right places.    i am a guy yeah.  i've seen some people who  male so hopefully not too big a deal.  guess i will just have to be more eager
i am a schizoid woman,i am a schizoid woman myself .  what do you think of us?  i wish i had a normal life and  but my brain won't let me form social bonds. 
i am a guy,the mma fighter would beat the shit out of that guy and  and i hope she would too if all he's trying to do is somehow prove that men are stronger than women.  seriously and  i would not want to go against a female mma fighter and  and i am a guy. 
i am a hot sauce guy,i am a hot sauce guy and  myself.  i prefer to keep both a bottle of louisiana style sauce and  and a bottle of sriracha around and  since they work better for different things.  i also prefer myself a good mayonnaise.  ketchup is  a guilty pleasure for me since i see it as being unsophisticated and  but it goes great with anything made from fried potatoes.  as for mustard and  i think it's a highly underrated topping and  and it's the best thing to put on a smokie next to saurkraut. 
i am a dead man,according to this article i live in the most unaffordable place in the entire nation.  i would have to make a minimum of $74k to live here.  only 24% of the jobs here pay more than $44k.  the average household earns $95k through combined incomes or commuting every day to manhattan.  i am an introvert with agoraphobia and  i can't stand crowded cities and public transportation.  i am so fucked when my parents die.  i am going to end up homeless.  i am a dead man walking and nobody gives a shit.  my therapist may be taking my last dimes while slowly coming to accept the hopelessness of my situation.  i have the developmental maturity of a 12-year old boy.  can you imagine asking an average 12-year old to move across the country and establish a home somewhere else? i am an overthinker and  there is no way i can do a repetitive mindless service job without having a mental breakdown within 2-3 months. 
i am a woman,>they found out i am a woman and  and they immediately asked azavii to ban me.   in that case being spared a ban probably makes sense.  despite what inceltears says and  the r/incels mods there banned with reason.  if you were not breaking any rules you could post.    but if you were an inceltears poster at the time and  i do not see how you were not banned and  since they did not allow people from that sub to post .  either you are not telling the truth or a ban was called only once and he forgot to check you profile. 
i am a woman,get out idiot.  we come here to autistically rage at how unfair the world is for men so we do not elsewhere and  and then you invade our personal space so there's no reason to remain here.    take your coping skills somewhere else.  coping is literally a meme on here.  i said soon and  *soon* and  and you cannot refute that you wanted to fuck before eighteen and  i will not believe you unless you're at least a female. only self esteem damaged men make it to college as virgins.  him being attractive has nothing to do with the lack of confidence and  and lack of knowledge he'll be experiencing and  if he were to lose it in college.  the only reason i ever come off as a misogynist is because feminism harasses me.  i am jealous of females and wish i had one and  and rage at the machine that is society.  then feminism takes it as an assault to say the they are the privileged ones rather than the men and  and suddenly i am a woman hating fake-nice-guy.  he is here because he feels the  incel brain kicking on and  and i say to him and  lose it soon or be damned.  if he were to be your personality type and  why is he here? it's not prefer i said and  you're doomed forever and  but said and  lose it soon.  he looks prefer he's old enough to be getting hs sex and  the ones that do not are doomed to eat soy for all time and  or worse and  they end up eating tendies and stay here.   t.  incel that's currently banned from braincels due to normals   invading
i am a woman,if she's putting in the effort to learn how to do asmr properly -  &nbsp;   buying microphones and  configuring microphones and  configuring software and  having a good computer to edit videos and post and  learning video editing and  learning photoshop for thumbnails and  editing her audio and  learning asmr meta - mouth cracking and  popping and  chewing and  eating and  whispering sounds and  bubbling sounds and  whatever doing her research to stay on top of the game - showing up and putting on makeup every day and  showering and  having a positive attitude all the time while recording and  flying out for these tv interviews and keeping herself composed and answering questions properly pr for nation-wide tv to make her livlihood of asmr look positive and respectable not prefer some creepy fetish which is why these people are interviewing her and  not being ugly and  keeping her weight in check and  learning youtube algorithms for video titles and tags and  interacting with audience if it's beneficial and  etc etc etc the list goes on and on.  maybe she has enough money at this point to hire someone to do all the work for her and  but she still has to show up and shower and  put make up on and  be happy and bubbly and  do the correct asmr sounds and  be healthy and  get her hair dyed or cut and eyelash extensions and  maybe her nails done and  fly out for these interviews and be pro interviewee    &nbsp;  it's a job at that point and she's not neet.  you sound just prefer a jealous man at a woman exploiting her attractiveness and/or comforting maternal qualities and being driven enough to put such hard work into the asmr genre.  if you were a woman it would be interesting to see how easy you think it would be to be alive.  i am a woman and i am not having a great time with life.  i do not want to whore myself or do any of these weird things women are doing and  i have no interest or drive to do them.  some women are too ugly or homely to be successful in these areas.  i am sure you've seen twitch chats shitting on ugly fat women. 
i am a gay guy,lol.   i am a gay guy myself and i tend to have a soft spot for good looking guys.  a couple years ago and  one of my interns tried to capitalize on this to get a full time position by flirting with me.  did not work for him and  though.  lol i went with the most competent guy and  who was not him. 
i am a fat neckbeard,he's right tho.  her body looks terrible.                               and inb4 i am a fat neckbeard.  i am lean and mean. 
i am a dude,i am not a homo and  but i act free prefer gays.  i am a dude and i dance prefer crazy and  and i go to spas and  and i prefer fashion and  and i prefer small dogs and  and the color pink and purple and  and flowers and  and rainbows and  and that  stuff .  in a few years it won't be wrongly associated to gay men and that is a relief.  because of what you just said and  
i am a woman,> i am a woman and  so i have experiences with myself every day.  :p  then your experience is invalid.  succubi can endure  and  because they await for courtship / prince charming.  for males the onus is on them and  so if they fail it's their fault and only theirs - either by being complacent or by trying hard yet failing and  males lose. 
i am a woman,what if i am a woman who's content with nice tits and a pretty face? 😂
i am a glass-half-full guy,hey and  you never know and  man.  it's a stretch and  but the advent of transhumanist technologies is pretty promising.  there's always the possibility that you'll be alive to witness legitimate and  working anti-aging procedures becoming available to the general public.  perhaps if not and  you could have yourself cryogenically frozen.    i mean and  if you get shot in the head and  you're done for.  if you're on your death bed in 30-40 years and  though and  you could get something setup to have yourself preserved at the moment of clinical death.    i am a glass-half-full  guy and  so i might seem more hopeful for this than what is realistic and  but you never know. 
i am a man,it's a damn shame and  man.  i prefer kids.  it's fun to teach them new things.  to pass on my knowledge.  can't do that as a man without some people making the assumption that you're a kiddy diddler.    i am expatting to se asia later this year and  though.  going to be teaching english part-time there.  hopefully the natives won't see me as a potential child molester and  simply because i am a man who enjoys teaching kids new things. 
i am a woman,i agree.  i am a woman but they seem pointless.  prefer what can you even feel?
i am a slim asian woman,i am a slim asian woman and no and  i am not going to post pics.  enjoy being blocked. 
i am a woman,well and  i am a woman.  newsflash and  women use the internet. 
i am a woman,i am a woman and  username should have made that obvious.  i do not drink because i do not trust men not to take advantage. 
i am a young woman,i would prefer one! i am a young woman who would so buy one if i saw it and would even get it online!
i am a young woman,i am a young woman and am thinking along those lines to be quite honest. 
i am a bigger guy,ok man and  thanks and  this is my first fit.  i am  a bigger guy so i can't really do skinnys. 
i am a bigger guy,i do not know if that would look good on me considering i am a bigger guy. 
i am a guy with eplilepsy,if they are about to hit the floor from standing  and you can catch em it might be wise to do so so they do not get brain damage.  then immediatly leave em alone.  restraining them will likely hurt you regardless of the kind.   do not take my word as gospel though as i am a guy with eplilepsy not a doctor. 
i am a guy,hi and  i am non-binary.   trans is an umbrella term and  many non-binary people identify as trans as well as nb.  not all and  but many.   gender x sounds prefer a non-binary gender and  considering how nb simply means .   i will use myself as an example.  i am trans.  to be more specific and  i am non-binary.  to be even more specific and  i am neutrois .   one should ask themselves whether their masc/femme/neutral leanings are related to their gender and  presentation and  or both.  presentation and interests do not entail gender: wearing a suit doesn't mean i am a guy and  wearing a dress doesn't mean i am a girl. 
i am a girl,hi and  i am non-binary.   trans is an umbrella term and  many non-binary people identify as trans as well as nb.  not all and  but many.   gender x sounds prefer a non-binary gender and  considering how nb simply means .   i will use myself as an example.  i am trans.  to be more specific and  i am non-binary.  to be even more specific and  i am neutrois .   one should ask themselves whether their masc/femme/neutral leanings are related to their gender and  presentation and  or both.  presentation and interests do not entail gender: wearing a suit doesn't mean i am a guy and  wearing a dress doesn't mean i am a girl. 
i am a guy,am also trans and  hello.  i am afab non-binary and  i usually just say i am a guy for simplicity's sake.  i really do not want to deal with emotional labour of non-binary 101 all the time.   i think the reason we both expected the worst is because that's  what we're used to having to deal with and  so that's what we prepare for.  but yeah and  i agree that being trans is generally way easier than both past and present n garbage.   my nmom has actually been really good with it all? prefer and  i expected to get kicked out  and she's said she'd be willing to drive me out of town for top surgery .   i think it's because she's not. really an n? she exhibits a bunch of the behaviours at times and  but she's not.  she's not a bad person and  just a shit parent.  prefer and  that's something a good friend might do for you and  she can do that.  actual parent stuff. varies wildly.  mostly not the best.   sorry if this was not the  answer you were looking for; this just . happened. 
i am a simple man,can you make a simple grocery list of whats good to eat while on a budget? i am a simple man trying to not overspend for food.  chicken and  gyros meat and  eggs and  sliced tomatoes and  fruit/veggies and  and peanut butter.  only drinking water.  what should i add to this?      edit: i also get various nuts prefer almond and pistachios. 
i am a bisexual guy,i am a bisexual guy and i am in a monogamous marriage with a woman.  my wife knows i am bi and have been with men.  anyone not okay with that i would have never been with it in the first place. 
i am a man,seriously and  how weird is that shit? i am a man with a fully functioning dick and  i could hang out with another woman than my wife and  i could get drunk with another woman and i still would not cheat on my wife because i just do not want to.  it's really concerning that pence has to try so hard and  it's prefer he's admitting 
i am a guy,not only does this post degrade women and  it degrades men too.  men are not wild animals with no self control.  i do not care if you're horny and  you can wait until you are home and then jerk off and  you do not have to sexually harass anyone.   i am a guy with a sex drive and a functioning dick.  i sometimes find myself sexually attracted to people who i pass by.  but i do not catcall and  i do not harass and  i do not sexually assault people.  i do not even have to make an effort to not sexually harass people.  my brain controls my dick rather than my dick controlling my brain.   your view is not unlike radical islamists who think women need to wear bags because they're too pathetic and weak to control their dicks.
