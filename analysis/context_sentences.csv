i live in california,hello and  all! on an unrelated note and  i hope you all had a good valentine's day.  :)  anyways and  for some background: i am 18 and  turning 19 in may.  i've only ever had one job and  working part-time and  minimum wage at my local mall and  and only ever had it for 3 months.  i live in california and  but if i do end up getting ssi and  i plan on moving to a state with a lower cost of living.   i have asperger's and  depression and  anxiety and  and social anxiety.  there might be more and  but that's all of what i feel comfortable self-diagnosing myself with at the moment.  i am getting scheduled for a full psychological evaluation and  though and  so soon and  i will be officially diagnosed.   once i get that diagnosis and  i plan on getting started on applying for ssi.  i've done a bit of research and  and am having an incredibly hard time figuring out exactly what i need aside from official medical paperwork and  a good social security lawyer and  and lots of patience.  i've heard the horror stories and  so i plan on documenting my entire paper trail myself and making copies of everything and  so if they  i can give them copies that i had ready just in case they   anyways and  onto my actual question/questions: what are the major pitfalls i should be aware of trying to apply for ssi? what should i do to maximize my chances for getting on it? what should i be concerned about if and when i do get on it so that i do not end up losing it?   that's all i can think of right now and  but if you have any other comments or answers for me and  i would greatly appreciate it.  thank you all so much!

i live in missouri,i live in missouri and my household has received no less than 11\~ or so blatant gop propaganda adverts in the mail over the last week or so.  you know and  the real pathetic ones with mccaskill poorly photoshopped as peering out from behind a busted border fence and  with a private jet in the background and  presumably waving at all the  to come on in.  plastered all over with blurbs about how the freedom hating democrats want to ban our bump stocks.  literally and  one of them was not even just a pro-gun argument and  but pro-bump stocks specifically.    &#x200b;  i am just so tired.

i live the same day,yeah i picked up meditation a few months ago and was able to mostly take control of my looping thoughts.  that was a great three months i had.   however and  various events since then have caused my overall motivation to slip down farther than it's ever been.  i have not meditated in a while.  i live the same day over and over.   i did my initial appointment with a psychiatrist last week and my next is on the 7th.   i've always wondered what other people consider to be normal for them.  my normal sucks i can't wait to rewire my brain. 
i live in scandinavia,well and  i live in scandinavia .  countries here are relatively safe and  there has been a lot of talk about terror lately and  and everyone is on watch.  we are being told to report most suspicious things.  there hasn't been any  incidents  though.  there might not be at all.  it is as safe as the us i would assume.

i live in ontario,i hate it so so much.  it's caused me so much grief that i can't even feel blessed to live in this country that everybody thinks is so great.  i know many people on this sub can only dream of living here and i am sorry if i seem ungrateful.  truth is and  canada is pretty great as long as you are not somali.  literally every other ethnicity has some merits in people's eyes.  you can be a respectable person of any other background.  but if you're somali and  you have to be close-minded and  backwards-thinking and  loud and  obnoxious and  racist and  ethnocentric and  and above all just plain *alien*.  you just have to be.  and if you're someone prefer me who doesn't accept that identity for themselves and  you become an anomaly for the rest of your life.  other somali people judge the shit out of you for daring to try and break the cycle of ignorance and  and they'll say you're trying too hard to be white or that you are full of self-hate.  and everybody else will fail to accept the new identity you try to carve and will forever treat you as that one somali kid that they know.  i hate it and it's made me hate me and everything around me.    i live in ontario and  canada and every single time i go outside i am reminded of how people see me.  the folks in my building ignore me when i say hello.  people are surprised when i speak coherently and actually sound intelligent.  believe me when i say the stereotype of canadians being so nice doesn't apply if you're somali.  and do not tell me that it's in my head or that i am only seeing these things because i look for them.  it's been this way my entire life.  i could never make friends with the non-muslim kids at my school no matter how hard i tried.  sure they'd talk to me if i talked to them first but actually hanging out or being close friends was always just out of the question.  i was always forced to fall in with the other muslim kids.  it was just *expected* and i hate that so much.  i've tried so hard to push past that barrier but i can't do it if society is so adamant on pushing back.  just today my new driving instructor asked me if i was somali and  and when i said yes he said .  i mean and  what the hell? yeah and  he might just be one rude guy but i know so many people who have that underlying sentiment and  and i am honestly  grateful now when people have the bluntness to just say it.  i do blame the ignorant somali people out there for this awful reputation they've garnered and  but i can't help but be disappointed when the people who claim to be so accepting and tolerant just can't see past my skin or my name.  i simply want to be seen as an individual.  i was born here and have never even left the country but i have never for one second felt prefer i belonged.   recently i've decided to just quit.  i am done smiling at people to try to make them not afraid or trying to strike up conversations to show how normal i am.  given the success rate vs.  the amount of times i am shunned and  it's not worth the effort anymore.  everybody else can make nice with each other and be as  as they want and  and i will live my life accepting that i am just not allowed to have that.  and i do not care what anyone says about accepting yourself or not letting your background define you.  fuck off.  it doesn't matter what i tell myself if everybody else lets it define me.  please do not tell me it's my fault for not accepting myself when nobody else accepts me either.  my negative feelings are a direct result of being ostracized all my life and  not the other way around.  it's not a self-fulfilling prophecy because i assure you i do my absolute best **every single day** to upturn people's perception of me.  i am sorry for being so angry about this but there hasn't been a single time i've brought up this grievance of mine without being told that the problem is my perception and i am tired of hearing it.  thank you for reading if you have.  i know this doesn't have much to do with leaving islam and  but to me leaving islam was also leaving any ties to my somali background.  and i am sorry but i think somali ex-muslims who try to hold on to their culture are kidding themselves.  i mean and  what culture is even left? islam stole it all away and burned it to the ground and  prefer it always does.  the only thing to do is to just try to be your own person and say fuck anyone who doesn't see that. 
i live in germany,where i live in germany tipping is not mandatory and you do not get shamed if you do not do so and  you can tip of course and they will be thankful for it and  but it is normal that you just pay the price that is on the bill.   i would suggest you only paying the bill and  there is no legal obgligation for you to tip. 
i live with girlfriend,so yeah i was pretty depressed for majority of my life and only lately i started realizing  that i always had  .  you know not remembering things clearly and having clouded mind in general.  the background info but the trip makes no sense without) i was also always lazy as fuck and even though everyone kept telling me how smart i am i was always the worst in school nearly flunked  several times and quit school at 15 etc.  i live with girlfriend of 3 years  and i am unhappy with her.  extremely anxious and self-conscious to go anywhere  .   a  deadbeat.    now yeah i had birthday recently and so we bought ton of weed  and i had lots of time alone to think and smoke.  looking back i realized that i started to feel and act on my impulse.  prefer i would get high and started to  numerology and naval charts etc.   well every single sentence fit me and even the physical traits.  and something along the lines of  well guess what? i discovered  ravi shankar music few months back! also that my spiritual lesson should be perseverance .  now this girl i have not seen for about 5-6 years has been trying to chat me up lately but i felt prefer such a shit i could not even reply.    well as i got super-high these past few days i realized that i have feelings haha. so i told myself  and told her straight that i do not mean anything bad by it and but that i do not feel prefer seeing anyone.  so yeah we started chatting pretty much for the next week straight all day .    so as i was high and finally for the first time in my life found someone who understood me and knew exactly what to say to make me think i got interested in who am i and anyway? so i  lots of psychological and behavioral traits that i  started noticing about me.  so in a sense i finally started understanding myself and realizing that i am not the outsider or weird guy.  i am just me and just prefer everyone else is.  me happens to be bit different but in a grand scheme of things not really.   so i was chatting and learning about myself and feeling  and smoking weed and working on my project  and finally everything felt so smooth.  as if i  got into the  .  prefer i knew exactly what to say and what to ask  and not to be ashamed for expressing myself.  needless to say my ego went through the roof and so did my project! i made more progress in past 5 days  than in couple of weeks.  but you know what? i have this tiny window of not remembering and after that window my progress disappeared! and i fucking know that i made that work because i sent screen to the girl and its visible on the shot.  why am i not mad at all? because i feel prefer that is exactly the point of this trip-perseverance! the green goddess showed me that its possible to do my work exactly as i want to do it and but i have to be truly perseverant and never abandon a project again.   it felt as if i was asleep these past few years and i just started coming back to be the real me.   there is also the part where i felt prefer i truly understood the sorrows of black people.  when i was watching some hiphop  and methodman says  i think i got it.  he feels everything more intensely and even such a trivial action as acting on his feelings  gets him bad rep and/or weird stares. basically a lot of pressure.  you know how black people seem too  for white ones? maybe they just do not lock all that shit inside and let it out that is why they might seem that way.   and when nobody truly understands you then you turn bad and hateful and evil .  or maybe i am just waaay too high and read too much into shit?  anyway the girl fell for me and is basically pleading with me to go out with her or that she will come to our  apartment. yet i feel that perseverance should be my lesson and i just know that if i fall in prefer i will focus all my attention to her again.  so i decided that until i truly fix my life and my financial freedom its best to not see her.    also the way i could  with that girl was not anything prefer me. i asked her questions about her own life and even prefer life and but not because i was jealous or wanted to compare and but because i truly cared what the other person is prefer.  just as well i am starting to feel lighter and lighter these days as if i finally noticed the light at the end of the tunel. basically it all feels prefer trip of awakening of sorts.   and the minor detail-i noticed there is certain dualism  in every person's face.  the ying and yang.  black and white.  evil and good.  feral and domesticated.  god and mortal.  everything and nothing.  whatever you call it i could see it.  if the photo is taken up-front especially.  try to crop half of the head and flip vertically and place opposite.  edit:no need to describe the whole process.  i noticed that some people have more  and angelic both sides while others have both  or ambitious sides.  some people have balanced faces.   i do not know how come but i can see it so let me know if you can too! so i can decide whether have i just achieved broader spiritual understanding or ran by milestone of madness. 
i live in hong kong a place,hello and thanks for taking your time on reading this post.   by this date and  i've been a neet for over 3 years.  i won't lie that while some part of me does enjoy the immense freedom i have and  deep down inside its killing me.  physically.  mentally.  emotionally.  it has ruined my ability to have any interpersonal connection in a physical and emotional way and has bruised what sense of hope and purpose i have in my life.  while it could be easier to say that i could blame so many factors on outside forces and  i can personally say that deep down inside and  i myself am too jaded and  too disappointed and  too depressed and far too off the deep end where i feel i can't possible climb out of.  i feel prefer a burden.  i feel constantly compared by the people i am close to who continue to not only try to help me put something forward in my life when they actively know i am incapable or simply do not care enough to try.   i am broken.  i feel weak.  i feel restless.  what years of youth i have felt is slowly being drained by my health and  my pride and  my lack of support and any sign that things can't get any better.  while i try to wrestle in some days with the effort to improve my life and  i feel it all for naught simply by the experiences i've had.  i do not know how long i can keep this up but every passing day i feel closer to the emptiness and voidless nothingness that is apparently my life.    i live in hong kong-- a place i could never relate to as an ethnic minority nor a place i could never call home due to my failure to intigrate into the culture and language which i thought was imperative to functionally well here.  when i was young and  my father left my mother in a state where we literally could not afford to survive and with the notorious conditions here and  we simply could not survive enough to be considered human.  i performed as well as i could to make my mother proud in some of those early years but as i grew older-- as i tried to learn myself and my emotions-- i somehow found myself channeling unmitgating rage and hatred for myself for not only myself-- but for even my peers and  my family and society as a whole.  i can't remember how many times i've fought-- how many arguments i've had-- or resentments that for some reason still stew inside me.    it affected me enough that i grew to despise my own culture and identity.  forced me to blame even my own mother-- my own origins for a father i never cared or wanted for-- put blame on applying myself to nothing more then the worthlessness i beleive i still feel now.    and i continue to be alone in the fact that perhaps i might be the only one not moving forward.   i could never pass through secoundary-- or what was equivilent to highschool-- and while i was involved-- attentive-- enough of being a good student i was given an opportunity to be more when my 2nd father came into our lives.   but i would never know if it was born out of prefer or nessicity due to the circumstances.  i do not know if what i felt was misplaced prefer for the man.  the wanting for a connection.  or the blissful ignorance that he could solve all our problems.  take us away from our situation.  but it was brief-- and the cause was none other then my mother herself.  what excuse i had for a father left us to return home to us in attempt to find some form of better life that deep down inside i beleive i never had with the circumstances with how it ended.  what i thought was my hope was nothing but a placebo taken away by a mother who refused to share her circumstance out of the same pride and  fear and ignorance that may have infected me.   by the time i knew that my conception and my mother's illegal occupation has forced not only her but me to remain in this city that would never be my own-- i was destroyed.  i had thought my stepfather would fight to at least not only have me but even my mother to join us in a land where i thought things would be a chance to get better were quickly dashed by the same loneliness and isolation i feared.   now.  we live in a box.  i spend more times staring at a box and  searching for meaningless joy and distraction within a box made of the circumstances that i could not control or even forsee.  i tried to apply for school but either due to lack of qualifications-- lack of planning-- lack of support from the only family member who sees me nothing more then a disappointment and failure-- lack of money we use to at least sustain ourselves with when my stepfather was here-- or his ability to keep everything afloat-- it was been nothing more then one drifting day of pain and  arguments and  tension and turmoil that has led any job interview-- school application and chance to be put forward into a cesspool of misery.   i do not know who i am anymore.  i do not know what i am anymore.  i do not know what i want to be-- what i want to do or what i can even do but sit in this box within a box and feel the emptiness of hopelessness.   i do not feel joy anymore and i have not cried as much as i have.  i need help but i do not think i can trust anyone anymore.   i am alone
i live in trinidad,i live in trinidad and  which is a short boatride from venezuela.  it is currently very unsafe to travel in many areas of trinidad's own territorial waters as there is currently a plague of venezuelan pirates roaming these waters.    there is a video circulating social media and  where fishermen are hijacked and  their boats were stolen and they were left stranded near offshore oil rigs.  the saddest part and  however and  is the fact that the main targets of the pirates are not the fishermen with proper boats and  but rather the poor venezuelans who are returning to their country after purchasing supplies in trinidad.   in their small and  underpowered craft and  they make for easy pickings. 
i live in fear that god,well shit i guess i will bite.  in three parts.   ____  **why believe in god?**  there are some objective reasons to suppose a god might exist.  the cosmological argument and  the hard problem of consciousness and  etc.  however and  i tend not to concern myself too much with defending these because the real reason anybody is going to believe is because they've experienced the living god personally in their lives.   ____  **why believe christianity?**  ok so my tried and true method for looking at religion involves splitting religion into several categories: paganism and  eastern religion and  abrahamic religion and  and contemporary personal religion.   regarding paganism: the big problem is that they can't all be true and  and i've asked norse pagans to explain to me why odin is the true head of the gods and  while zeus is not.  the response is.  in fact.  that they are all true.  paganism is inherently subjective and basically suggests that i and  as a british person and  should be believing in some  anglo-saxon paganism and  but if i was in china i would be all about chinese folk religion.  these religions also lack any concise theology so there's not much in the way of analytic framework gained from being pagan.   regarding eastern religions: ok.  this is difficult because right now i am in the middle of looking more into eastern religions.  thus i actually have no comment.  i have not been convinced by my discussions so far and  but i do not judge religions until i know them very well.  so this is an incomplete justification for christianity and  i am afraid.   regarding abrahamic religions: alright.  long story short: the narrative of judeo-christianity is incredible.  it's just mindblowing.  everything works together perfectly.  there are a myriad of reasons to reject islam and  but the simplest reason to reject it is just because.  it's such an immensely pointless religion.  the whole point of christianity is that the jewish faith said we needed to obey all these rules in order to atone for our sins and  but then christ fulfilled the law and now we are made righteous through faith.  every other abrahamic religion offers up and   i am trying to be as concise as possible here and  because this is a huge question you've asked and  mate and  but that's the simplest account.   contemporary personal religions: so one question is.  why not just make up your own religion? why not just take everything that makes complete sense and say and  yeah that's right.  this is how you get a lot of the modern religions and  but the problem is.  these religions have not been tried and tested by time.  yes.  i am sure some dude could develop a theological framework that would actually make more sense to me than any ancient religion and  but it making more sense to me is not much of a basis for belief compared to the testimony of religions that have survived generations.   _____   **why be reformed?**  ok so discussions of 30 and 000 denominations aside and  the main denominations from my perspective are: cathodoxy and  anglicanism and  lutheranism and  pentecostalism and  baptism and  and reformed theology.   so i would start by just laying out what christianity means to me: it means that we are saved because of what god has done to us.  it means we are spiritually equal before christ.  it means that we have a true living gospel that is not contingent upon ancient tradition to retain some  spiritual or mystic authority.  for this reason: i reject any denomination that relies on tradition; any denomination that uses ancient dead languages; any denomination that claims the leadership has a unique ability to be undeniably correct about all things; and any denomination that affords special attire to their leadership to mark them as special and unique position relative to the common church-going plebs.  this and  in one fell swoop and  knocks out cathodoxy and  anglicanism and  and lutheranism.    pentecostalism's big problem is how it is tradition of another name.  again and  the gospel of christianity is plain and simple and  and is convicting without the need for pretensions to miraculous capabilities or direct prophetic revelation from god.  i subscribe to full throttle no thrills christianity.  the other big problem with pentecostalism is so many of the alleged miracles on which their theology is practically dependent are routinely shown to be false or trickery.  i actually do not have a problem with baptists.  some of them think i am not saved and reject calvinism and  but many of them are reformed baptists.  my disagreements with baptists are incredibly minor and not worthy of much interest to an atheist.   so why reformed? well.  obviously i think it's scripturally sound and  although therein lies a huge debate.  i also think it has been attested to by many christians throughout the church's history and  although therein lies a huge debate.  but my biggest reasons are two fold: one and  because i should not have been saved.  i was not looking to get saved.  i was not worthy of salvation.  i did not choose to get saved.  god saved me.  and he did not just.  begin the process of saving me.  he picked up my lifeless body and  out of an ocean of sin and  and breathed new life into me and  and now i am forever his.  another reason is and  when i appear before god almighty and  do i want to be the guy giving god all the credit? do i want to be the guy thanking god in absolute subjection knowing that the only thing i contributed to my salvation was the sin that made it necessary? do i live in fear that god might say and   no.  but if i believed the opposite and  that i played any role in my own salvation and  i would be filled with fear.  i could never be confident that what i would done had been enough.  and when i appeared before god he might well say and   if god is going to judge me wholly unworthy to enter his kingdom and  i would rather beat him to the punch.   and yes.  i am sure this is wholly insufficient.  but to be fair.  you did ask to have the entire reason to accept not just the existence of god and  not just a particular religion and  but a particular sect of that religion and  justified to you in one comment.  the response of any thinking person would be painfully stretched by the scope of the question.  thank god i have not looked sufficiently into the eastern faiths yet.   however and  by all means ask any questions you prefer.   god be with you. 
i live in michigan,well just so happens i live in michigan and have been to detroit many times.  mostly talking about downtown/midtown/elmwood but you're right even parts of those places are barren lots and abandoned buildings. 
i live on to grind another day,i live on to grind another day!  today went pretty good.  i reached 95 firemaking and  i finally got my full pyro set .   tomorrow i plan to hit lv99  firemaking before i sleep and  so wish me luck.  i am excited and  i can't wait to level up hp and other stats again and  but i really want to stay here until i get a tome and  hopefully i get lucky and  i still have another 100-150 kills to go and  there's hope i get it before 99 fm.    anyway and  here's the stats for day 6:  
i live in a perfect communist utopia,>everyday i wake up to browse the same dull threads and  watch the same videos and  and listen to the same songs.  not only is everything becoming so stale and completely unenjoyable  as a older neet who has lived prefer this 3/4s of my life and actually enjoys living prefer this here's my advice.    you have 24 hour a day free access to every song and  movie and  documentary and book ever made.  you have thousands of free lectures on any subject you can imagine.  there are thriving reddit communities for every niche interest you have.  you have access to detailed video guides for any subject you can imagine.  there are plenty of cheap aaa games on steam.   use this time to develop yourself.  do not just be content listening to the same music over and over again and watching generic mainstream movies when you have so much room to explore and build taste.   there is so much shit for me to do on the internet that 24 hours a day literally is not enough time.  you could pause time right now and i would not run out of movies and albums and shit in my backlog for years and it's growing larger every day.  the amount of content i've already gone through is more than most people will go through in their entire lifetime.  that is a very rare and unique experience in the history of our species.   i almost feel prefer i live in a perfect communist utopia here.  money has become a completely meaningless concept for me.  time is now my currency.  if i won the powerball lottery tomorrow my life literally would not change at all.  i would move into my own place and get some healthcare but that's about it.  i would still be alone in my room on the computer 23 hours a day.

i live in ontario and canada and every single time i go outside i am reminded of how people see me,i hate it so so much.  it's caused me so much grief that i can't even feel blessed to live in this country that everybody thinks is so great.  i know many people on this sub can only dream of living here and i am sorry if i seem ungrateful.  truth is and  canada is pretty great as long as you are not somali.  literally every other ethnicity has some merits in people's eyes.  you can be a respectable person of any other background.  but if you're somali and  you have to be close-minded and  backwards-thinking and  loud and  obnoxious and  racist and  ethnocentric and  and above all just plain *alien*.  you just have to be.  and if you're someone prefer me who doesn't accept that identity for themselves and  you become an anomaly for the rest of your life.  other somali people judge the shit out of you for daring to try and break the cycle of ignorance and  and they'll say you're trying too hard to be white or that you are full of self-hate.  and everybody else will fail to accept the new identity you try to carve and will forever treat you as that one somali kid that they know.  i hate it and it's made me hate me and everything around me.    i live in ontario and  canada and every single time i go outside i am reminded of how people see me.  the folks in my building ignore me when i say hello.  people are surprised when i speak coherently and actually sound intelligent.  believe me when i say the stereotype of canadians being so nice doesn't apply if you're somali.  and do not tell me that it's in my head or that i am only seeing these things because i look for them.  it's been this way my entire life.  i could never make friends with the non-muslim kids at my school no matter how hard i tried.  sure they'd talk to me if i talked to them first but actually hanging out or being close friends was always just out of the question.  i was always forced to fall in with the other muslim kids.  it was just *expected* and i hate that so much.  i've tried so hard to push past that barrier but i can't do it if society is so adamant on pushing back.  just today my new driving instructor asked me if i was somali and  and when i said yes he said .  i mean and  what the hell? yeah and  he might just be one rude guy but i know so many people who have that underlying sentiment and  and i am honestly  grateful now when people have the bluntness to just say it.  i do blame the ignorant somali people out there for this awful reputation they've garnered and  but i can't help but be disappointed when the people who claim to be so accepting and tolerant just can't see past my skin or my name.  i simply want to be seen as an individual.  i was born here and have never even left the country but i have never for one second felt prefer i belonged.   recently i've decided to just quit.  i am done smiling at people to try to make them not afraid or trying to strike up conversations to show how normal i am.  given the success rate vs.  the amount of times i am shunned and  it's not worth the effort anymore.  everybody else can make nice with each other and be as  as they want and  and i will live my life accepting that i am just not allowed to have that.  and i do not care what anyone says about accepting yourself or not letting your background define you.  fuck off.  it doesn't matter what i tell myself if everybody else lets it define me.  please do not tell me it's my fault for not accepting myself when nobody else accepts me either.  my negative feelings are a direct result of being ostracized all my life and  not the other way around.  it's not a self-fulfilling prophecy because i assure you i do my absolute best **every single day** to upturn people's perception of me.  i am sorry for being so angry about this but there hasn't been a single time i've brought up this grievance of mine without being told that the problem is my perception and i am tired of hearing it.  thank you for reading if you have.  i know this doesn't have much to do with leaving islam and  but to me leaving islam was also leaving any ties to my somali background.  and i am sorry but i think somali ex-muslims who try to hold on to their culture are kidding themselves.  i mean and  what culture is even left? islam stole it all away and burned it to the ground and  prefer it always does.  the only thing to do is to just try to be your own person and say fuck anyone who doesn't see that.

i live in germany,where i live in germany tipping is not mandatory and you do not get shamed if you do not do so and  you can tip of course and they will be thankful for it and  but it is normal that you just pay the price that is on the bill.   i would suggest you only paying the bill and  there is no legal obgligation for you to tip. 
i live with girlfriend of 3 years and i am unhappy with her,so yeah i was pretty depressed for majority of my life and only lately i started realizing  that i always had  .  you know not remembering things clearly and having clouded mind in general.  the background info but the trip makes no sense without) i was also always lazy as fuck and even though everyone kept telling me how smart i am i was always the worst in school nearly flunked  several times and quit school at 15 etc.  i live with girlfriend of 3 years  and i am unhappy with her.  extremely anxious and self-conscious to go anywhere  .   a  deadbeat.    now yeah i had birthday recently and so we bought ton of weed  and i had lots of time alone to think and smoke.  looking back i realized that i started to feel and act on my impulse.  prefer i would get high and started to  numerology and naval charts etc.   well every single sentence fit me and even the physical traits.  and something along the lines of  well guess what? i discovered  ravi shankar music few months back! also that my spiritual lesson should be perseverance .  now this girl i have not seen for about 5-6 years has been trying to chat me up lately but i felt prefer such a shit i could not even reply.    well as i got super-high these past few days i realized that i have feelings haha. so i told myself  and told her straight that i do not mean anything bad by it and but that i do not feel prefer seeing anyone.  so yeah we started chatting pretty much for the next week straight all day .    so as i was high and finally for the first time in my life found someone who understood me and knew exactly what to say to make me think i got interested in who am i and anyway? so i  lots of psychological and behavioral traits that i  started noticing about me.  so in a sense i finally started understanding myself and realizing that i am not the outsider or weird guy.  i am just me and just prefer everyone else is.  me happens to be bit different but in a grand scheme of things not really.   so i was chatting and learning about myself and feeling  and smoking weed and working on my project  and finally everything felt so smooth.  as if i  got into the  .  prefer i knew exactly what to say and what to ask  and not to be ashamed for expressing myself.  needless to say my ego went through the roof and so did my project! i made more progress in past 5 days  than in couple of weeks.  but you know what? i have this tiny window of not remembering and after that window my progress disappeared! and i fucking know that i made that work because i sent screen to the girl and its visible on the shot.  why am i not mad at all? because i feel prefer that is exactly the point of this trip-perseverance! the green goddess showed me that its possible to do my work exactly as i want to do it and but i have to be truly perseverant and never abandon a project again.   it felt as if i was asleep these past few years and i just started coming back to be the real me.   there is also the part where i felt prefer i truly understood the sorrows of black people.  when i was watching some hiphop  and methodman says  i think i got it.  he feels everything more intensely and even such a trivial action as acting on his feelings  gets him bad rep and/or weird stares. basically a lot of pressure.  you know how black people seem too  for white ones? maybe they just do not lock all that shit inside and let it out that is why they might seem that way.   and when nobody truly understands you then you turn bad and hateful and evil .  or maybe i am just waaay too high and read too much into shit?  anyway the girl fell for me and is basically pleading with me to go out with her or that she will come to our  apartment. yet i feel that perseverance should be my lesson and i just know that if i fall in prefer i will focus all my attention to her again.  so i decided that until i truly fix my life and my financial freedom its best to not see her.    also the way i could  with that girl was not anything prefer me. i asked her questions about her own life and even prefer life and but not because i was jealous or wanted to compare and but because i truly cared what the other person is prefer.  just as well i am starting to feel lighter and lighter these days as if i finally noticed the light at the end of the tunel. basically it all feels prefer trip of awakening of sorts.   and the minor detail-i noticed there is certain dualism  in every person's face.  the ying and yang.  black and white.  evil and good.  feral and domesticated.  god and mortal.  everything and nothing.  whatever you call it i could see it.  if the photo is taken up-front especially.  try to crop half of the head and flip vertically and place opposite.  edit:no need to describe the whole process.  i noticed that some people have more  and angelic both sides while others have both  or ambitious sides.  some people have balanced faces.   i do not know how come but i can see it so let me know if you can too! so i can decide whether have i just achieved broader spiritual understanding or ran by milestone of madness.

i live in hong kong a place i could never relate to as an ethnic minority nor a place i could never call home due to my failure to intigrate into the culture and language which i thought was imperative to functionally well here,hello and thanks for taking your time on reading this post.   by this date and  i've been a neet for over 3 years.  i won't lie that while some part of me does enjoy the immense freedom i have and  deep down inside its killing me.  physically.  mentally.  emotionally.  it has ruined my ability to have any interpersonal connection in a physical and emotional way and has bruised what sense of hope and purpose i have in my life.  while it could be easier to say that i could blame so many factors on outside forces and  i can personally say that deep down inside and  i myself am too jaded and  too disappointed and  too depressed and far too off the deep end where i feel i can't possible climb out of.  i feel prefer a burden.  i feel constantly compared by the people i am close to who continue to not only try to help me put something forward in my life when they actively know i am incapable or simply do not care enough to try.   i am broken.  i feel weak.  i feel restless.  what years of youth i have felt is slowly being drained by my health and  my pride and  my lack of support and any sign that things can't get any better.  while i try to wrestle in some days with the effort to improve my life and  i feel it all for naught simply by the experiences i've had.  i do not know how long i can keep this up but every passing day i feel closer to the emptiness and voidless nothingness that is apparently my life.    i live in hong kong-- a place i could never relate to as an ethnic minority nor a place i could never call home due to my failure to intigrate into the culture and language which i thought was imperative to functionally well here.  when i was young and  my father left my mother in a state where we literally could not afford to survive and with the notorious conditions here and  we simply could not survive enough to be considered human.  i performed as well as i could to make my mother proud in some of those early years but as i grew older-- as i tried to learn myself and my emotions-- i somehow found myself channeling unmitgating rage and hatred for myself for not only myself-- but for even my peers and  my family and society as a whole.  i can't remember how many times i've fought-- how many arguments i've had-- or resentments that for some reason still stew inside me.    it affected me enough that i grew to despise my own culture and identity.  forced me to blame even my own mother-- my own origins for a father i never cared or wanted for-- put blame on applying myself to nothing more then the worthlessness i beleive i still feel now.    and i continue to be alone in the fact that perhaps i might be the only one not moving forward.   i could never pass through secoundary-- or what was equivilent to highschool-- and while i was involved-- attentive-- enough of being a good student i was given an opportunity to be more when my 2nd father came into our lives.   but i would never know if it was born out of prefer or nessicity due to the circumstances.  i do not know if what i felt was misplaced prefer for the man.  the wanting for a connection.  or the blissful ignorance that he could solve all our problems.  take us away from our situation.  but it was brief-- and the cause was none other then my mother herself.  what excuse i had for a father left us to return home to us in attempt to find some form of better life that deep down inside i beleive i never had with the circumstances with how it ended.  what i thought was my hope was nothing but a placebo taken away by a mother who refused to share her circumstance out of the same pride and  fear and ignorance that may have infected me.   by the time i knew that my conception and my mother's illegal occupation has forced not only her but me to remain in this city that would never be my own-- i was destroyed.  i had thought my stepfather would fight to at least not only have me but even my mother to join us in a land where i thought things would be a chance to get better were quickly dashed by the same loneliness and isolation i feared.   now.  we live in a box.  i spend more times staring at a box and  searching for meaningless joy and distraction within a box made of the circumstances that i could not control or even forsee.  i tried to apply for school but either due to lack of qualifications-- lack of planning-- lack of support from the only family member who sees me nothing more then a disappointment and failure-- lack of money we use to at least sustain ourselves with when my stepfather was here-- or his ability to keep everything afloat-- it was been nothing more then one drifting day of pain and  arguments and  tension and turmoil that has led any job interview-- school application and chance to be put forward into a cesspool of misery.   i do not know who i am anymore.  i do not know what i am anymore.  i do not know what i want to be-- what i want to do or what i can even do but sit in this box within a box and feel the emptiness of hopelessness.   i do not feel joy anymore and i have not cried as much as i have.  i need help but i do not think i can trust anyone anymore.   i am alone

i live in trinidad and which is a short boatride from venezuela,i live in trinidad and  which is a short boatride from venezuela.  it is currently very unsafe to travel in many areas of trinidad's own territorial waters as there is currently a plague of venezuelan pirates roaming these waters.    there is a video circulating social media and  where fishermen are hijacked and  their boats were stolen and they were left stranded near offshore oil rigs.  the saddest part and  however and  is the fact that the main targets of the pirates are not the fishermen with proper boats and  but rather the poor venezuelans who are returning to their country after purchasing supplies in trinidad.   in their small and  underpowered craft and  they make for easy pickings.

i live on to grind another day,i live on to grind another day!  today went pretty good.  i reached 95 firemaking and  i finally got my full pyro set .   tomorrow i plan to hit lv99  firemaking before i sleep and  so wish me luck.  i am excited and  i can't wait to level up hp and other stats again and  but i really want to stay here until i get a tome and  hopefully i get lucky and  i still have another 100-150 kills to go and  there's hope i get it before 99 fm.    anyway and  here's the stats for day 6:  
i live in a perfect communist utopia,>everyday i wake up to browse the same dull threads and  watch the same videos and  and listen to the same songs.  not only is everything becoming so stale and completely unenjoyable  as a older neet who has lived prefer this 3/4s of my life and actually enjoys living prefer this here's my advice.    you have 24 hour a day free access to every song and  movie and  documentary and book ever made.  you have thousands of free lectures on any subject you can imagine.  there are thriving reddit communities for every niche interest you have.  you have access to detailed video guides for any subject you can imagine.  there are plenty of cheap aaa games on steam.   use this time to develop yourself.  do not just be content listening to the same music over and over again and watching generic mainstream movies when you have so much room to explore and build taste.   there is so much shit for me to do on the internet that 24 hours a day literally is not enough time.  you could pause time right now and i would not run out of movies and albums and shit in my backlog for years and it's growing larger every day.  the amount of content i've already gone through is more than most people will go through in their entire lifetime.  that is a very rare and unique experience in the history of our species.   i almost feel prefer i live in a perfect communist utopia here.  money has become a completely meaningless concept for me.  time is now my currency.  if i won the powerball lottery tomorrow my life literally would not change at all.  i would move into my own place and get some healthcare but that's about it.  i would still be alone in my room on the computer 23 hours a day.

i live near houston,thank you!! this is very helpful.  i do prefer to read and  but was unsure where to find good books.  i will definitely check out that reading list.   yes! i agree that communication is key.  i believe that's what attracted me to bdsm.  it just feels more intimate because of the communication.  but since we both are new to this and do not have others to support us.  we find ourselves a little unsure how to proceed.  that is why i am glad to have found this sub.  it's nice not to feel alone or weird.  i did not know about fetlife and  but i am  excited to check it out.  i am unsure about my community and  but i live near houston.   i am hoping houston has some groups to help us.  thank you again for the advice.  sorry about the formatting and  on a mobile.

i live the same day over and over,yeah i picked up meditation a few months ago and was able to mostly take control of my looping thoughts.  that was a great three months i had.   however and  various events since then have caused my overall motivation to slip down farther than it's ever been.  i have not meditated in a while.  i live the same day over and over.   i did my initial appointment with a psychiatrist last week and my next is on the 7th.   i've always wondered what other people consider to be normal for them.  my normal sucks i can't wait to rewire my brain.

i live in ontario and canada and every single time i go outside i am reminded of how people see me,i hate it so so much.  it's caused me so much grief that i can't even feel blessed to live in this country that everybody thinks is so great.  i know many people on this sub can only dream of living here and i am sorry if i seem ungrateful.  truth is and  canada is pretty great as long as you are not somali.  literally every other ethnicity has some merits in people's eyes.  you can be a respectable person of any other background.  but if you're somali and  you have to be close-minded and  backwards-thinking and  loud and  obnoxious and  racist and  ethnocentric and  and above all just plain *alien*.  you just have to be.  and if you're someone prefer me who doesn't accept that identity for themselves and  you become an anomaly for the rest of your life.  other somali people judge the shit out of you for daring to try and break the cycle of ignorance and  and they'll say you're trying too hard to be white or that you are full of self-hate.  and everybody else will fail to accept the new identity you try to carve and will forever treat you as that one somali kid that they know.  i hate it and it's made me hate me and everything around me.    i live in ontario and  canada and every single time i go outside i am reminded of how people see me.  the folks in my building ignore me when i say hello.  people are surprised when i speak coherently and actually sound intelligent.  believe me when i say the stereotype of canadians being so nice doesn't apply if you're somali.  and do not tell me that it's in my head or that i am only seeing these things because i look for them.  it's been this way my entire life.  i could never make friends with the non-muslim kids at my school no matter how hard i tried.  sure they'd talk to me if i talked to them first but actually hanging out or being close friends was always just out of the question.  i was always forced to fall in with the other muslim kids.  it was just *expected* and i hate that so much.  i've tried so hard to push past that barrier but i can't do it if society is so adamant on pushing back.  just today my new driving instructor asked me if i was somali and  and when i said yes he said .  i mean and  what the hell? yeah and  he might just be one rude guy but i know so many people who have that underlying sentiment and  and i am honestly  grateful now when people have the bluntness to just say it.  i do blame the ignorant somali people out there for this awful reputation they've garnered and  but i can't help but be disappointed when the people who claim to be so accepting and tolerant just can't see past my skin or my name.  i simply want to be seen as an individual.  i was born here and have never even left the country but i have never for one second felt prefer i belonged.   recently i've decided to just quit.  i am done smiling at people to try to make them not afraid or trying to strike up conversations to show how normal i am.  given the success rate vs.  the amount of times i am shunned and  it's not worth the effort anymore.  everybody else can make nice with each other and be as  as they want and  and i will live my life accepting that i am just not allowed to have that.  and i do not care what anyone says about accepting yourself or not letting your background define you.  fuck off.  it doesn't matter what i tell myself if everybody else lets it define me.  please do not tell me it's my fault for not accepting myself when nobody else accepts me either.  my negative feelings are a direct result of being ostracized all my life and  not the other way around.  it's not a self-fulfilling prophecy because i assure you i do my absolute best **every single day** to upturn people's perception of me.  i am sorry for being so angry about this but there hasn't been a single time i've brought up this grievance of mine without being told that the problem is my perception and i am tired of hearing it.  thank you for reading if you have.  i know this doesn't have much to do with leaving islam and  but to me leaving islam was also leaving any ties to my somali background.  and i am sorry but i think somali ex-muslims who try to hold on to their culture are kidding themselves.  i mean and  what culture is even left? islam stole it all away and burned it to the ground and  prefer it always does.  the only thing to do is to just try to be your own person and say fuck anyone who doesn't see that.

i live in germany,where i live in germany tipping is not mandatory and you do not get shamed if you do not do so and  you can tip of course and they will be thankful for it and  but it is normal that you just pay the price that is on the bill.   i would suggest you only paying the bill and  there is no legal obgligation for you to tip. 
i live with girlfriend of 3 years and i am unhappy with her,so yeah i was pretty depressed for majority of my life and only lately i started realizing  that i always had  .  you know not remembering things clearly and having clouded mind in general.  the background info but the trip makes no sense without) i was also always lazy as fuck and even though everyone kept telling me how smart i am i was always the worst in school nearly flunked  several times and quit school at 15 etc.  i live with girlfriend of 3 years  and i am unhappy with her.  extremely anxious and self-conscious to go anywhere  .   a  deadbeat.    now yeah i had birthday recently and so we bought ton of weed  and i had lots of time alone to think and smoke.  looking back i realized that i started to feel and act on my impulse.  prefer i would get high and started to  numerology and naval charts etc.   well every single sentence fit me and even the physical traits.  and something along the lines of  well guess what? i discovered  ravi shankar music few months back! also that my spiritual lesson should be perseverance .  now this girl i have not seen for about 5-6 years has been trying to chat me up lately but i felt prefer such a shit i could not even reply.    well as i got super-high these past few days i realized that i have feelings haha. so i told myself  and told her straight that i do not mean anything bad by it and but that i do not feel prefer seeing anyone.  so yeah we started chatting pretty much for the next week straight all day .    so as i was high and finally for the first time in my life found someone who understood me and knew exactly what to say to make me think i got interested in who am i and anyway? so i  lots of psychological and behavioral traits that i  started noticing about me.  so in a sense i finally started understanding myself and realizing that i am not the outsider or weird guy.  i am just me and just prefer everyone else is.  me happens to be bit different but in a grand scheme of things not really.   so i was chatting and learning about myself and feeling  and smoking weed and working on my project  and finally everything felt so smooth.  as if i  got into the  .  prefer i knew exactly what to say and what to ask  and not to be ashamed for expressing myself.  needless to say my ego went through the roof and so did my project! i made more progress in past 5 days  than in couple of weeks.  but you know what? i have this tiny window of not remembering and after that window my progress disappeared! and i fucking know that i made that work because i sent screen to the girl and its visible on the shot.  why am i not mad at all? because i feel prefer that is exactly the point of this trip-perseverance! the green goddess showed me that its possible to do my work exactly as i want to do it and but i have to be truly perseverant and never abandon a project again.   it felt as if i was asleep these past few years and i just started coming back to be the real me.   there is also the part where i felt prefer i truly understood the sorrows of black people.  when i was watching some hiphop  and methodman says  i think i got it.  he feels everything more intensely and even such a trivial action as acting on his feelings  gets him bad rep and/or weird stares. basically a lot of pressure.  you know how black people seem too  for white ones? maybe they just do not lock all that shit inside and let it out that is why they might seem that way.   and when nobody truly understands you then you turn bad and hateful and evil .  or maybe i am just waaay too high and read too much into shit?  anyway the girl fell for me and is basically pleading with me to go out with her or that she will come to our  apartment. yet i feel that perseverance should be my lesson and i just know that if i fall in prefer i will focus all my attention to her again.  so i decided that until i truly fix my life and my financial freedom its best to not see her.    also the way i could  with that girl was not anything prefer me. i asked her questions about her own life and even prefer life and but not because i was jealous or wanted to compare and but because i truly cared what the other person is prefer.  just as well i am starting to feel lighter and lighter these days as if i finally noticed the light at the end of the tunel. basically it all feels prefer trip of awakening of sorts.   and the minor detail-i noticed there is certain dualism  in every person's face.  the ying and yang.  black and white.  evil and good.  feral and domesticated.  god and mortal.  everything and nothing.  whatever you call it i could see it.  if the photo is taken up-front especially.  try to crop half of the head and flip vertically and place opposite.  edit:no need to describe the whole process.  i noticed that some people have more  and angelic both sides while others have both  or ambitious sides.  some people have balanced faces.   i do not know how come but i can see it so let me know if you can too! so i can decide whether have i just achieved broader spiritual understanding or ran by milestone of madness. 
i live with girlfriend,so yeah i was pretty depressed for majority of my life and only lately i started realizing  that i always had  .  you know not remembering things clearly and having clouded mind in general.  the background info but the trip makes no sense without) i was also always lazy as fuck and even though everyone kept telling me how smart i am i was always the worst in school nearly flunked  several times and quit school at 15 etc.  i live with girlfriend of 3 years  and i am unhappy with her.  extremely anxious and self-conscious to go anywhere  .   a  deadbeat.    now yeah i had birthday recently and so we bought ton of weed  and i had lots of time alone to think and smoke.  looking back i realized that i started to feel and act on my impulse.  prefer i would get high and started to  numerology and naval charts etc.   well every single sentence fit me and even the physical traits.  and something along the lines of  well guess what? i discovered  ravi shankar music few months back! also that my spiritual lesson should be perseverance .  now this girl i have not seen for about 5-6 years has been trying to chat me up lately but i felt prefer such a shit i could not even reply.    well as i got super-high these past few days i realized that i have feelings haha. so i told myself  and told her straight that i do not mean anything bad by it and but that i do not feel prefer seeing anyone.  so yeah we started chatting pretty much for the next week straight all day .    so as i was high and finally for the first time in my life found someone who understood me and knew exactly what to say to make me think i got interested in who am i and anyway? so i  lots of psychological and behavioral traits that i  started noticing about me.  so in a sense i finally started understanding myself and realizing that i am not the outsider or weird guy.  i am just me and just prefer everyone else is.  me happens to be bit different but in a grand scheme of things not really.   so i was chatting and learning about myself and feeling  and smoking weed and working on my project  and finally everything felt so smooth.  as if i  got into the  .  prefer i knew exactly what to say and what to ask  and not to be ashamed for expressing myself.  needless to say my ego went through the roof and so did my project! i made more progress in past 5 days  than in couple of weeks.  but you know what? i have this tiny window of not remembering and after that window my progress disappeared! and i fucking know that i made that work because i sent screen to the girl and its visible on the shot.  why am i not mad at all? because i feel prefer that is exactly the point of this trip-perseverance! the green goddess showed me that its possible to do my work exactly as i want to do it and but i have to be truly perseverant and never abandon a project again.   it felt as if i was asleep these past few years and i just started coming back to be the real me.   there is also the part where i felt prefer i truly understood the sorrows of black people.  when i was watching some hiphop  and methodman says  i think i got it.  he feels everything more intensely and even such a trivial action as acting on his feelings  gets him bad rep and/or weird stares. basically a lot of pressure.  you know how black people seem too  for white ones?

i live in hong kong a place i could never relate to as an ethnic minority nor a place i could never call home due to my failure to intigrate into the culture and language which i thought was imperative to functionally well here,hello and thanks for taking your time on reading this post.   by this date and  i've been a neet for over 3 years.  i won't lie that while some part of me does enjoy the immense freedom i have and  deep down inside its killing me.  physically.  mentally.  emotionally.  it has ruined my ability to have any interpersonal connection in a physical and emotional way and has bruised what sense of hope and purpose i have in my life.  while it could be easier to say that i could blame so many factors on outside forces and  i can personally say that deep down inside and  i myself am too jaded and  too disappointed and  too depressed and far too off the deep end where i feel i can't possible climb out of.  i feel prefer a burden.  i feel constantly compared by the people i am close to who continue to not only try to help me put something forward in my life when they actively know i am incapable or simply do not care enough to try.   i am broken.  i feel weak.  i feel restless.  what years of youth i have felt is slowly being drained by my health and  my pride and  my lack of support and any sign that things can't get any better.  while i try to wrestle in some days with the effort to improve my life and  i feel it all for naught simply by the experiences i've had.  i do not know how long i can keep this up but every passing day i feel closer to the emptiness and voidless nothingness that is apparently my life.    i live in hong kong-- a place i could never relate to as an ethnic minority nor a place i could never call home due to my failure to intigrate into the culture and language which i thought was imperative to functionally well here.  when i was young and  my father left my mother in a state where we literally could not afford to survive and with the notorious conditions here and  we simply could not survive enough to be considered human.  i performed as well as i could to make my mother proud in some of those early years but as i grew older-- as i tried to learn myself and my emotions-- i somehow found myself channeling unmitgating rage and hatred for myself for not only myself-- but for even my peers and  my family and society as a whole.  i can't remember how many times i've fought-- how many arguments i've had-- or resentments that for some reason still stew inside me.    it affected me enough that i grew to despise my own culture and identity.  forced me to blame even my own mother-- my own origins for a father i never cared or wanted for-- put blame on applying myself to nothing more then the worthlessness i beleive i still feel now.    and i continue to be alone in the fact that perhaps i might be the only one not moving forward.   i could never pass through secoundary-- or what was equivilent to highschool-- and while i was involved-- attentive-- enough of being a good student i was given an opportunity to be more when my 2nd father came into our lives.   but i would never know if it was born out of prefer or nessicity due to the circumstances.  i do not know if what i felt was misplaced prefer for the man.  the wanting for a connection.  or the blissful ignorance that he could solve all our problems.  take us away from our situation.  but it was brief-- and the cause was none other then my mother herself.  what excuse i had for a father left us to return home to us in attempt to find some form of better life that deep down inside i beleive i never had with the circumstances with how it ended.  what i thought was my hope was nothing but a placebo taken away by a mother who refused to share her circumstance out of the same pride and  fear and ignorance that may have infected me.   by the time i knew that my conception and my mother's illegal occupation has forced not only her but me to remain in this city that would never be my own-- i was destroyed.  i had thought my stepfather would fight to at least not only have me but even my mother to join us in a land where i thought things would be a chance to get better were quickly dashed by the same loneliness and isolation i feared.   now.  we live in a box.  i spend more times staring at a box and  searching for meaningless joy and distraction within a box made of the circumstances that i could not control or even forsee.  i tried to apply for school but either due to lack of qualifications-- lack of planning-- lack of support from the only family member who sees me nothing more then a disappointment and failure-- lack of money we use to at least sustain ourselves with when my stepfather was here-- or his ability to keep everything afloat-- it was been nothing more then one drifting day of pain and  arguments and  tension and turmoil that has led any job interview-- school application and chance to be put forward into a cesspool of misery.   i do not know who i am anymore.  i do not know what i am anymore.  i do not know what i want to be-- what i want to do or what i can even do but sit in this box within a box and feel the emptiness of hopelessness.   i do not feel joy anymore and i have not cried as much as i have.  i need help but i do not think i can trust anyone anymore.   i am alone

i live in trinidad and which is a short boatride from venezuela,i live in trinidad and  which is a short boatride from venezuela.  it is currently very unsafe to travel in many areas of trinidad's own territorial waters as there is currently a plague of venezuelan pirates roaming these waters.    there is a video circulating social media and  where fishermen are hijacked and  their boats were stolen and they were left stranded near offshore oil rigs.  the saddest part and  however and  is the fact that the main targets of the pirates are not the fishermen with proper boats and  but rather the poor venezuelans who are returning to their country after purchasing supplies in trinidad.   in their small and  underpowered craft and  they make for easy pickings.

i live on to grind another day,i live on to grind another day!  today went pretty good.  i reached 95 firemaking and  i finally got my full pyro set .   tomorrow i plan to hit lv99  firemaking before i sleep and  so wish me luck.  i am excited and  i can't wait to level up hp and other stats again and  but i really want to stay here until i get a tome and  hopefully i get lucky and  i still have another 100-150 kills to go and  there's hope i get it before 99 fm.    anyway and  here's the stats for day 6:  
i live in a perfect communist utopia,>everyday i wake up to browse the same dull threads and  watch the same videos and  and listen to the same songs.  not only is everything becoming so stale and completely unenjoyable  as a older neet who has lived prefer this 3/4s of my life and actually enjoys living prefer this here's my advice.    you have 24 hour a day free access to every song and  movie and  documentary and book ever made.  you have thousands of free lectures on any subject you can imagine.  there are thriving reddit communities for every niche interest you have.  you have access to detailed video guides for any subject you can imagine.  there are plenty of cheap aaa games on steam.   use this time to develop yourself.  do not just be content listening to the same music over and over again and watching generic mainstream movies when you have so much room to explore and build taste.   there is so much shit for me to do on the internet that 24 hours a day literally is not enough time.  you could pause time right now and i would not run out of movies and albums and shit in my backlog for years and it's growing larger every day.  the amount of content i've already gone through is more than most people will go through in their entire lifetime.  that is a very rare and unique experience in the history of our species.   i almost feel prefer i live in a perfect communist utopia here.  money has become a completely meaningless concept for me.  time is now my currency.  if i won the powerball lottery tomorrow my life literally would not change at all.  i would move into my own place and get some healthcare but that's about it.  i would still be alone in my room on the computer 23 hours a day.

i live near houston,thank you!! this is very helpful.  i do prefer to read and  but was unsure where to find good books.  i will definitely check out that reading list.   yes! i agree that communication is key.  i believe that's what attracted me to bdsm.  it just feels more intimate because of the communication.  but since we both are new to this and do not have others to support us.  we find ourselves a little unsure how to proceed.  that is why i am glad to have found this sub.  it's nice not to feel alone or weird.  i did not know about fetlife and  but i am  excited to check it out.  i am unsure about my community and  but i live near houston.   i am hoping houston has some groups to help us.  thank you again for the advice.  sorry about the formatting and  on a mobile.

i live the same day over and over,yeah i picked up meditation a few months ago and was able to mostly take control of my looping thoughts.  that was a great three months i had.   however and  various events since then have caused my overall motivation to slip down farther than it's ever been.  i have not meditated in a while.  i live the same day over and over.   i did my initial appointment with a psychiatrist last week and my next is on the 7th.   i've always wondered what other people consider to be normal for them.  my normal sucks i can't wait to rewire my brain.

i live in ontario and canada and every single time i go outside i am reminded of how people see me,i hate it so so much.  it's caused me so much grief that i can't even feel blessed to live in this country that everybody thinks is so great.  i know many people on this sub can only dream of living here and i am sorry if i seem ungrateful.  truth is and  canada is pretty great as long as you are not somali.  literally every other ethnicity has some merits in people's eyes.  you can be a respectable person of any other background.  but if you're somali and  you have to be close-minded and  backwards-thinking and  loud and  obnoxious and  racist and  ethnocentric and  and above all just plain *alien*.  you just have to be.  and if you're someone prefer me who doesn't accept that identity for themselves and  you become an anomaly for the rest of your life.  other somali people judge the shit out of you for daring to try and break the cycle of ignorance and  and they'll say you're trying too hard to be white or that you are full of self-hate.  and everybody else will fail to accept the new identity you try to carve and will forever treat you as that one somali kid that they know.  i hate it and it's made me hate me and everything around me.    i live in ontario and  canada and every single time i go outside i am reminded of how people see me.  the folks in my building ignore me when i say hello.  people are surprised when i speak coherently and actually sound intelligent.  believe me when i say the stereotype of canadians being so nice doesn't apply if you're somali.  and do not tell me that it's in my head or that i am only seeing these things because i look for them.  it's been this way my entire life.  i could never make friends with the non-muslim kids at my school no matter how hard i tried.  sure they'd talk to me if i talked to them first but actually hanging out or being close friends was always just out of the question.  i was always forced to fall in with the other muslim kids.  it was just *expected* and i hate that so much.  i've tried so hard to push past that barrier but i can't do it if society is so adamant on pushing back.  just today my new driving instructor asked me if i was somali and  and when i said yes he said .  i mean and  what the hell? yeah and  he might just be one rude guy but i know so many people who have that underlying sentiment and  and i am honestly  grateful now when people have the bluntness to just say it.  i do blame the ignorant somali people out there for this awful reputation they've garnered and  but i can't help but be disappointed when the people who claim to be so accepting and tolerant just can't see past my skin or my name.  i simply want to be seen as an individual.  i was born here and have never even left the country but i have never for one second felt prefer i belonged.   recently i've decided to just quit.  i am done smiling at people to try to make them not afraid or trying to strike up conversations to show how normal i am.  given the success rate vs.  the amount of times i am shunned and  it's not worth the effort anymore.  everybody else can make nice with each other and be as  as they want and  and i will live my life accepting that i am just not allowed to have that.  and i do not care what anyone says about accepting yourself or not letting your background define you.  fuck off.  it doesn't matter what i tell myself if everybody else lets it define me.  please do not tell me it's my fault for not accepting myself when nobody else accepts me either.  my negative feelings are a direct result of being ostracized all my life and  not the other way around.  it's not a self-fulfilling prophecy because i assure you i do my absolute best **every single day** to upturn people's perception of me.  i am sorry for being so angry about this but there hasn't been a single time i've brought up this grievance of mine without being told that the problem is my perception and i am tired of hearing it.  thank you for reading if you have.  i know this doesn't have much to do with leaving islam and  but to me leaving islam was also leaving any ties to my somali background.  and i am sorry but i think somali ex-muslims who try to hold on to their culture are kidding themselves.  i mean and  what culture is even left? islam stole it all away and burned it to the ground and  prefer it always does.  the only thing to do is to just try to be your own person and say fuck anyone who doesn't see that.

i live in germany,where i live in germany tipping is not mandatory and you do not get shamed if you do not do so and  you can tip of course and they will be thankful for it and  but it is normal that you just pay the price that is on the bill.   i would suggest you only paying the bill and  there is no legal obgligation for you to tip. 
i live with girlfriend of 3 years and i am unhappy with her,so yeah i was pretty depressed for majority of my life and only lately i started realizing  that i always had  .  you know not remembering things clearly and having clouded mind in general.  the background info but the trip makes no sense without) i was also always lazy as fuck and even though everyone kept telling me how smart i am i was always the worst in school nearly flunked  several times and quit school at 15 etc.  i live with girlfriend of 3 years  and i am unhappy with her.  extremely anxious and self-conscious to go anywhere  .   a  deadbeat.    now yeah i had birthday recently and so we bought ton of weed  and i had lots of time alone to think and smoke.  looking back i realized that i started to feel and act on my impulse.  prefer i would get high and started to  numerology and naval charts etc.   well every single sentence fit me and even the physical traits.  and something along the lines of  well guess what? i discovered  ravi shankar music few months back! also that my spiritual lesson should be perseverance .  now this girl i have not seen for about 5-6 years has been trying to chat me up lately but i felt prefer such a shit i could not even reply.    well as i got super-high these past few days i realized that i have feelings haha. so i told myself  and told her straight that i do not mean anything bad by it and but that i do not feel prefer seeing anyone.  so yeah we started chatting pretty much for the next week straight all day .    so as i was high and finally for the first time in my life found someone who understood me and knew exactly what to say to make me think i got interested in who am i and anyway? so i  lots of psychological and behavioral traits that i  started noticing about me.  so in a sense i finally started understanding myself and realizing that i am not the outsider or weird guy.  i am just me and just prefer everyone else is.  me happens to be bit different but in a grand scheme of things not really.   so i was chatting and learning about myself and feeling  and smoking weed and working on my project  and finally everything felt so smooth.  as if i  got into the  .  prefer i knew exactly what to say and what to ask  and not to be ashamed for expressing myself.  needless to say my ego went through the roof and so did my project! i made more progress in past 5 days  than in couple of weeks.  but you know what? i have this tiny window of not remembering and after that window my progress disappeared! and i fucking know that i made that work because i sent screen to the girl and its visible on the shot.  why am i not mad at all? because i feel prefer that is exactly the point of this trip-perseverance! the green goddess showed me that its possible to do my work exactly as i want to do it and but i have to be truly perseverant and never abandon a project again.   it felt as if i was asleep these past few years and i just started coming back to be the real me.   there is also the part where i felt prefer i truly understood the sorrows of black people.  when i was watching some hiphop  and methodman says  i think i got it.  he feels everything more intensely and even such a trivial action as acting on his feelings  gets him bad rep and/or weird stares. basically a lot of pressure.  you know how black people seem too  for white ones? maybe they just do not lock all that shit inside and let it out that is why they might seem that way.   and when nobody truly understands you then you turn bad and hateful and evil .  or maybe i am just waaay too high and read too much into shit?  anyway the girl fell for me and is basically pleading with me to go out with her or that she will come to our  apartment. yet i feel that perseverance should be my lesson and i just know that if i fall in prefer i will focus all my attention to her again.  so i decided that until i truly fix my life and my financial freedom its best to not see her.    also the way i could  with that girl was not anything prefer me. i asked her questions about her own life and even prefer life and but not because i was jealous or wanted to compare and but because i truly cared what the other person is prefer.  just as well i am starting to feel lighter and lighter these days as if i finally noticed the light at the end of the tunel. basically it all feels prefer trip of awakening of sorts.   and the minor detail-i noticed there is certain dualism  in every person's face.  the ying and yang.  black and white.  evil and good.  feral and domesticated.  god and mortal.  everything and nothing.  whatever you call it i could see it.  if the photo is taken up-front especially.  try to crop half of the head and flip vertically and place opposite.  edit:no need to describe the whole process.  i noticed that some people have more  and angelic both sides while others have both  or ambitious sides.  some people have balanced faces.   i do not know how come but i can see it so let me know if you can too! so i can decide whether have i just achieved broader spiritual understanding or ran by milestone of madness.

i live in hong kong a place i could never relate to as an ethnic minority nor a place i could never call home due to my failure to intigrate into the culture and language which i thought was imperative to functionally well here,hello and thanks for taking your time on reading this post.   by this date and  i've been a neet for over 3 years.  i won't lie that while some part of me does enjoy the immense freedom i have and  deep down inside its killing me.  physically.  mentally.  emotionally.  it has ruined my ability to have any interpersonal connection in a physical and emotional way and has bruised what sense of hope and purpose i have in my life.  while it could be easier to say that i could blame so many factors on outside forces and  i can personally say that deep down inside and  i myself am too jaded and  too disappointed and  too depressed and far too off the deep end where i feel i can't possible climb out of.  i feel prefer a burden.  i feel constantly compared by the people i am close to who continue to not only try to help me put something forward in my life when they actively know i am incapable or simply do not care enough to try.   i am broken.  i feel weak.  i feel restless.  what years of youth i have felt is slowly being drained by my health and  my pride and  my lack of support and any sign that things can't get any better.  while i try to wrestle in some days with the effort to improve my life and  i feel it all for naught simply by the experiences i've had.  i do not know how long i can keep this up but every passing day i feel closer to the emptiness and voidless nothingness that is apparently my life.    i live in hong kong-- a place i could never relate to as an ethnic minority nor a place i could never call home due to my failure to intigrate into the culture and language which i thought was imperative to functionally well here.  when i was young and  my father left my mother in a state where we literally could not afford to survive and with the notorious conditions here and  we simply could not survive enough to be considered human.  i performed as well as i could to make my mother proud in some of those early years but as i grew older-- as i tried to learn myself and my emotions-- i somehow found myself channeling unmitgating rage and hatred for myself for not only myself-- but for even my peers and  my family and society as a whole.  i can't remember how many times i've fought-- how many arguments i've had-- or resentments that for some reason still stew inside me.    it affected me enough that i grew to despise my own culture and identity.  forced me to blame even my own mother-- my own origins for a father i never cared or wanted for-- put blame on applying myself to nothing more then the worthlessness i beleive i still feel now.    and i continue to be alone in the fact that perhaps i might be the only one not moving forward.   i could never pass through secoundary-- or what was equivilent to highschool-- and while i was involved-- attentive-- enough of being a good student i was given an opportunity to be more when my 2nd father came into our lives.   but i would never know if it was born out of prefer or nessicity due to the circumstances.  i do not know if what i felt was misplaced prefer for the man.  the wanting for a connection.  or the blissful ignorance that he could solve all our problems.  take us away from our situation.  but it was brief-- and the cause was none other then my mother herself.  what excuse i had for a father left us to return home to us in attempt to find some form of better life that deep down inside i beleive i never had with the circumstances with how it ended.  what i thought was my hope was nothing but a placebo taken away by a mother who refused to share her circumstance out of the same pride and  fear and ignorance that may have infected me.   by the time i knew that my conception and my mother's illegal occupation has forced not only her but me to remain in this city that would never be my own-- i was destroyed.  i had thought my stepfather would fight to at least not only have me but even my mother to join us in a land where i thought things would be a chance to get better were quickly dashed by the same loneliness and isolation i feared.   now.  we live in a box.  i spend more times staring at a box and  searching for meaningless joy and distraction within a box made of the circumstances that i could not control or even forsee.  i tried to apply for school but either due to lack of qualifications-- lack of planning-- lack of support from the only family member who sees me nothing more then a disappointment and failure-- lack of money we use to at least sustain ourselves with when my stepfather was here-- or his ability to keep everything afloat-- it was been nothing more then one drifting day of pain and  arguments and  tension and turmoil that has led any job interview-- school application and chance to be put forward into a cesspool of misery.   i do not know who i am anymore.  i do not know what i am anymore.  i do not know what i want to be-- what i want to do or what i can even do but sit in this box within a box and feel the emptiness of hopelessness.   i do not feel joy anymore and i have not cried as much as i have.  i need help but i do not think i can trust anyone anymore.   i am alone

some days with the effort to improve my life and  i feel it all for naught simply by the experiences i've had.  i do not know how long i can keep this up but every passing day i feel closer to the emptiness and voidless nothingness that is apparently my life.    i live in hong kong-- a place i could never relate to as an ethnic minority nor a place i could never call home due to my failure to intigrate into the culture and language which i thought was imperative to functionally well here.  when i was young and  my father left my mother in a state where we literally could not afford to survive and with the notorious conditions here and  we simply could not survive enough to be considered human.  i performed as well as i could to make my mother proud in some of those early years but as i grew older-- as i tried to learn myself and my emotions-- i somehow found myself channeling unmitgating rage and hatred for myself for not only myself-- but for even my peers and  my family and society as a whole.  i can't remember how many times i've fought-- how many arguments i've had-- or resentments that for some reason still stew inside me.    it affected me enough that i grew to despise my own culture and identity.  forced me to blame even my own mother-- my own origins for a father i never cared or wanted for-- put blame on applying myself to nothing more then the worthlessness i beleive i still feel now.    and i continue to be alone in the fact that perhaps i might be the only one not moving forward.   i could never pass through secoundary-- or what was equivilent to highschool-- and while i was involved-- attentive-- enough of being a good student i was given an opportunity to be more when my 2nd father came into our lives.   but i would never know if it was born out of prefer or nessicity due to the circumstances.  i do not know if what i felt was misplaced prefer for the man.  the wanting for a connection.  or the blissful ignorance that he could solve all our problems.  take us away from our situation.  but it was brief-- and the cause was none other then my mother herself.  what excuse i had for a father left us to return home to us in attempt to find some form of better life that deep down inside i beleive i never had with the circumstances with how it ended.  what i thought was my hope was nothing but a placebo taken away by a mother who refused to share her circumstance out of the same pride and  fear and ignorance that may have infected me.   by the time i knew that my conception and my mother's illegal occupation has forced not only her but me to remain in this city that would never be my own-- i was destroyed.  i had thought my stepfather would fight to at least not only have me but even my mother to join us in a land where i thought things would be a chance to get better were quickly dashed by the same loneliness and isolation i feared.   now.  we live in a box.  i spend more times staring at a box and  searching for meaningless joy and distraction within a box made of the circumstances that i could not control or even forsee.  i tried to apply for school but either due to lack of qualifications-- lack of planning-- lack of support from the only family member who sees me nothing more then a disappointment and failure-- lack of money we use to at least sustain ourselves with when my stepfather was here-- or his ability to keep everything afloat-- it was been nothing more then one drifting day of pain and  arguments and  tension and turmoil that has led any job interview-- school application and chance to be put forward into a cesspool of misery.   i do not know who i am anymore.  i do not know what i am anymore.  i do not know what i want to be-- what i want to do or what i can even do but sit in this box within a box and feel the emptiness of hopelessness.   i do not feel joy anymore and i have not cried as much as i have.  i need help but i do not think i can trust anyone anymore.   i am alone
i live in trinidad and which is a short boatride from venezuela,i live in trinidad and  which is a short boatride from venezuela.  it is currently very unsafe to travel in many areas of trinidad's own territorial waters as there is currently a plague of venezuelan pirates roaming these waters.    there is a video circulating social media and  where fishermen are hijacked and  their boats were stolen and they were left stranded near offshore oil rigs.  the saddest part and  however and  is the fact that the main targets of the pirates are not the fishermen with proper boats and  but rather the poor venezuelans who are returning to their country after purchasing supplies in trinidad.   in their small and  underpowered craft and  they make for easy pickings.

i live in a country that is not predominantly catholic,in my experience as somebody who ministers to catholics.  they are incredibly easy to convert to another denomination.  i live in a country that is not predominantly catholic.  and yet the vast majority of people i've converted while ministering have been catholic.  followed by muslims.  then atheists. 
i live in fear that god,well shit i guess i will bite.  in three parts.   ____  **why believe in god?**  there are some objective reasons to suppose a god might exist.  the cosmological argument and  the hard problem of consciousness and  etc.  however and  i tend not to concern myself too much with defending these because the real reason anybody is going to believe is because they've experienced the living god personally in their lives.   ____  **why believe christianity?**  ok so my tried and true method for looking at religion involves splitting religion into several categories: paganism and  eastern religion and  abrahamic religion and  and contemporary personal religion.   regarding paganism: the big problem is that they can't all be true and  and i've asked norse pagans to explain to me why odin is the true head of the gods and  while zeus is not.  the response is.  in fact.  that they are all true.  paganism is inherently subjective and basically suggests that i and  as a british person and  should be believing in some  anglo-saxon paganism and  but if i was in china i would be all about chinese folk religion.  these religions also lack any concise theology so there's not much in the way of analytic framework gained from being pagan.   regarding eastern religions: ok.  this is difficult because right now i am in the middle of looking more into eastern religions.  thus i actually have no comment.  i have not been convinced by my discussions so far and  but i do not judge religions until i know them very well.  so this is an incomplete justification for christianity and  i am afraid.   regarding abrahamic religions: alright.  long story short: the narrative of judeo-christianity is incredible.  it's just mindblowing.  everything works together perfectly.  there are a myriad of reasons to reject islam and  but the simplest reason to reject it is just because.  it's such an immensely pointless religion.  the whole point of christianity is that the jewish faith said we needed to obey all these rules in order to atone for our sins and  but then christ fulfilled the law and now we are made righteous through faith.  every other abrahamic religion offers up and   i am trying to be as concise as possible here and  because this is a huge question you've asked and  mate and  but that's the simplest account.   contemporary personal religions: so one question is.  why not just make up your own religion? why not just take everything that makes complete sense and say and  yeah that's right.  this is how you get a lot of the modern religions and  but the problem is.  these religions have not been tried and tested by time.  yes.  i am sure some dude could develop a theological framework that would actually make more sense to me than any ancient religion and  but it making more sense to me is not much of a basis for belief compared to the testimony of religions that have survived generations.   _____   **why be reformed?**  ok so discussions of 30 and 000 denominations aside and  the main denominations from my perspective are: cathodoxy and  anglicanism and  lutheranism and  pentecostalism and  baptism and  and reformed theology.   so i would start by just laying out what christianity means to me: it means that we are saved because of what god has done to us.  it means we are spiritually equal before christ.  it means that we have a true living gospel that is not contingent upon ancient tradition to retain some  spiritual or mystic authority.  for this reason: i reject any denomination that relies on tradition; any denomination that uses ancient dead languages; any denomination that claims the leadership has a unique ability to be undeniably correct about all things; and any denomination that affords special attire to their leadership to mark them as special and unique position relative to the common church-going plebs.  this and  in one fell swoop and  knocks out cathodoxy and  anglicanism and  and lutheranism.    pentecostalism's big problem is how it is tradition of another name.  again and  the gospel of christianity is plain and simple and  and is convicting without the need for pretensions to miraculous capabilities or direct prophetic revelation from god.  i subscribe to full throttle no thrills christianity.  the other big problem with pentecostalism is so many of the alleged miracles on which their theology is practically dependent are routinely shown to be false or trickery.  i actually do not have a problem with baptists.  some of them think i am not saved and reject calvinism and  but many of them are reformed baptists.  my disagreements with baptists are incredibly minor and not worthy of much interest to an atheist.   so why reformed? well.  obviously i think it's scripturally sound and  although therein lies a huge debate.  i also think it has been attested to by many christians throughout the church's history and  although therein lies a huge debate.  but my biggest reasons are two fold: one and  because i should not have been saved.  i was not looking to get saved.  i was not worthy of salvation.  i did not choose to get saved.  god saved me.  and he did not just.  begin the process of saving me.  he picked up my lifeless body and  out of an ocean of sin and  and breathed new life into me and  and now i am forever his.  another reason is and  when i appear before god almighty and  do i want to be the guy giving god all the credit? do i want to be the guy thanking god in absolute subjection knowing that the only thing i contributed to my salvation was the sin that made it necessary? do i live in fear that god might say and   no.  but if i believed the opposite and  that i played any role in my own salvation and  i would be filled with fear.  i could never be confident that what i would done had been enough.  and when i appeared before god he might well say and   if god is going to judge me wholly unworthy to enter his kingdom and  i would rather beat him to the punch.   and yes.  i am sure this is wholly insufficient.  but to be fair.  you did ask to have the entire reason to accept not just the existence of god and  not just a particular religion and  but a particular sect of that religion and  justified to you in one comment.  the response of any thinking person would be painfully stretched by the scope of the question.  thank god i have not looked sufficiently into the eastern faiths yet.   however and  by all means ask any questions you prefer.   god be with you. 
i live with my father and sister and have had very few jobs that lasted a couple of months at best and dropped out of college,hello. my name is chuck.  i grew up in a family with an enraged father who was always raging at something and  whether it was him breaking his tennis rackets for lost games and  chasing and following cars with roadrage and  or fighting and yelling at my mother.  i compare him to the abusive drunk and  yet the scariest part was he was always sober.  he would yell at me and my sister to be quiet and  whip us with a large leather belt when we were not and  and i was terrified and still am somewhat.   one day and  he was arguing with my mother and  and it got so bad and  that my mother was crying and  my sister and i were huddled in our room and  crying.  he was hitting my mother and  kicking her.  he threw open our door and  dragged us out and  put us on a chair and  and said that he wanted us to watch as he beat my mom some more.  a couple years of failed therapy later  and  they divorced and  my mother and  sister and i moved to monterey park and  enrolled in middle school there and  and lived in a small 1 bedroom apartment.  my father had visitation rights and  once a week we would go out with him and  eat dinner and  visit the park maybe. but he would force me to listen to him attentively and  sometimes for hours without break and  and would get extremely angry with me if i did not.  keep in mind i was around 12 years old at the time.   school was absolute hell.  it was primarily asians and mexicans and  and the bullies were everywhere.  teachers who did not care and  recess supervisors who did nothing to stop them.  the bullying i received was constant and  day in and out and  criticizing everything about me and  how i looked and  smelled and  acted and  how sane i was and  everything about me was wrong and  inhuman and  abnormal.  it was a hell of suffering and  pain and  embarrassment and  and self doubt.   one day and  on my way home from school with my friend and  2 highschoolers stopped us and  told us to kneel before and worship them.  i ran and cried and hid.  another day and  i was pantsed in front of my entire class by the regular bully who got nothing but a slap on the wrist of and  'do not do that'.  i started getting severe anxiety going to school and  painful stomach aches and gas and  which just made things even more embarrassing.  i withdrew from others.  it was not safe.  i would be attacked by everyone.  i wanted to die.  every second of everyday i wanted it to end.  school was my very own personal hell and  and i was forced to endure it.   years passed and  i graduated and got into a high school for the performing arts on cello.  the teachers were kind and  the kids accepting.  but the damage had already been done.  i wore headphones and sunglasses so that i would not have to speak to anyone in the halls.  i dreaded having to potentially be criticized on how i acted and talked.  my mother remarried unfortunately to someone just prefer my father and  but worse and  because he did not care for me nor my sister.  my step father was prone to extreme outbursts of anger and yelling.  we were forced to eventually move into his mother's old house and  who was a packrat from the great depression years.  this only made things worse as he made sure to hold it over my head that he was paying for my living and  food and  and music.  he called me boy and  regularly made fun of me and  and looked down on me.  we got into several fights and  one and  which i was forced to sleep outside in a sleeping bag.  eventually he kicked me out and  i went to live with my grandmother and  who was kind.   my real father unfortunately and  would call me reguarly after school and  and tell me exactly what he thought i should be doing with my life and  what was wrong and  what i should do and  how and  when and  etc.  he would get angry if i refused or did not do as he commanded me.  i hated him so much and just wanted him to leave me alone.  i spent my days curled in a corner of my room and  door locked and  not wanting to think and  feel and  or live.  i turned to overeating and masturbation in an attempt to feel anything good in my life.  in my junior year of high school and  i attempted my first of many attempted suicides and  using my grandmother's kitchen knife.  i could not go through with it- i was terrified of any action because of how people would criticize and judge me.  as time passed and  i watched helplessly as my peers found girlfriends and  decided on colleges and  charted out their lives and  and made good friends.  i quit cello and  stopped playing in orchestra and  barely graduated highschool and  and later would struggle for years in college and  dropping out of many classes.   all i wanted was to be normal and  to have the same things everyone else had.  friends and  girlfriends and  futures and  safety to be themselves.  it's been many years. i am now 30 and  i've had many painful relationships that were disasters and  anyone even remotely resembling bullies from my past or my father instantly puts me on high alert guard.  i live with my father and sister and  have had very few jobs that lasted a couple of months at best and  dropped out of college.  i am regularly anxious and  stressed out and  exhausted emotionally and  and frustrated.  i stay at home and  playing overwatch and other steam games desperately reading online ways to pull myself out of this living hell.  i sometimes get extremely angry when people are assholes or do not meet my expectations and  and i hate myself for it.  i wish i could be normal. i know that most likely people will criticize me and say and   and  or  and  etc etc.  but what they do not realize is that i am not working with the same set of tools they have.  they see other people and they do not see them as threats and  as attackers and  they do not feel their inner security is ever threatened by random persons.   i am sorry and  this has turned into a long life story rant and  but if anyone has advice or help they could offer me or point me towards and  i would be grateful.  thank you.

i live in the uk and so far every gym i have been to encourages full power sparring,> again and  you're sparring way too hard.  either your coaches are fucking garbage or your entire gym is and  because you should never be allowed to get bombed and beat up.   agree too much here.  people at my gym say hard sparring is the best way to get ready for a fight and  and most spar hard and  save for a few of my buddies and the beginners.  there's a casual/white collar squad and an olympic squad.  the olympic guys look prefer they go full blast in sparring.   yes and  it gets you ready for a fight and  but it also shortens your career span significantly due to brain damage and injuries.  i live in the uk and  so far every gym i have been to encourages full power sparring.  no wonder uk fighters are not as good as american fighters and  because uk fighters get slowed reflexes and cognitive impairment from hard sparring every session for several months to years.  from what i've read in this sub and  most people do not go more than 50% when sparring.  probably because most people here are from the usa.  usa amateur training > uk amateur training and  ime.   smh and  gyms that encourage full power sparring.  can't a guy enjoy a sport and get better at it without getting his face disfigured and his brain turned into soup?
i live in the west midlands,any boxing gyms in the uk that hold classes more than 3 days a week? i live in the west midlands.  willing to travel within 15 miles of where i live.  i've already searched but there's only one gym which i did not prefer and  having 6 days a week of open training.  considering almost all the gyms i tried are only 3 days a week of classes and  could i compete on only 3 days a week of training?

i live in california,being a trump supporter only made me stronger.   i am 17.  white.  and i live in california.  on election day last november i proudly wore a  shirt and all the non-white hyper liberals asked me why i would wear a shirt that supports bigotry.  everyone at my school that day told me donald trump was not going to be our next president but i assured them that clinton and the rest of the dnc had burned too many people. 
i live in brazil and and here most people watch anime with no problem,i live in brazil and  and here most people watch anime with no problem.  we have crunchyroll and other anime apps   the thing is that a lot of people here watch anime and they are always translating stuff and  but i do not think they are exactly legal.  anyway and  there are some sites that are just asked to low the video quality a bit and  and they manage to keep their anime content.    but all of that is just based on some advices i read quickly through some of the countless times i watched anime through apps/sites.       and so on.   but i think things prefer piracy are  hard to control in these levels.  if a site/app is disabled and  there will always be more people sharing their translations and  etc.   in other words and  anime is life here haha

i live in europe,i live in europe.  dropped out of law school 2-3 years ago.  from the societal perspective nothing happened since then.  from my perspective a lot of things in me changed for the better.  with the years i have also become very sensitive and it's nearly unbearable to function with most people.  to the normal person i am very friendly and open and  but literally as soon as one unpleasurable thing happens in a relationship and  even if it's a person throwing jokes that i do not appreciate and  or talking in a manner that i can't stand and  i am already seeking for a way out and  got no endurance for that.  i have the guts to confront people and  but try to be nice about it; so maybe this could mean that technically i could stand people if i had to and  but with no prolonged contact.   there is zero chance of me going back to the university again.  the things that interest me are probably in no way able to support me because the majority of people's desires focus outside of those areas.  i am interested mostly in spiritual and esoteric stuff and  and my interests are niche even in those areas! because of the spiritual interest i have contemplated entering all sorts of monasteries and  but i do not think i will be able to do it for many reasons and  so i opted out.   i would prefer to help people and  but i guess i would not ever want to make it a job and  it would just destroy me.  i helped family and friends here and there with some success and  but even that was really heavy on me.  tutoring that i did in the past is out of the way and  teaching is out of the way as well i guess because i just feel terribly empty teaching stuff that i am not passionate about.   **the thing is that i could actually feel happy just being in a homeless shelter if they allowed to have a laptop there and  and occasionally go out to use the internet and  take a walk and  etc.  that's literally all i need.  i can borderline starve and  i eat only two sweets per day and  i can shower one-two times a week and  i do not need a girlfriend and  i do not need a family and  i do not even really need friends. **  i seriously considered that and i told that to my family and  who were torn between acceptance and disbelief.  but **from what i read and  the people in homeless shelters and  they actually want to go back to working 24/7 and the caretakers there actually have a mission to implement them back into the molochian societal machine. ** to me that's a joke.  i would be there because i can't stand the society and can't find any place in it for me and  not because i  and socialize with people talking how good it once was .   because of that problem with homeless shelters and  i started thinking - maybe i will have to work after all.  the only work i would be able to do would be for ideological reasons  or personal reasons   i thought of becoming a truck driver and  train driver maybe for personal reasons.  but  and  when i ask myself deeply if that's what i would do for the rest of my life.  i get a firm no.  i could do it for a few years maximum probably.  and even then i would do it mostly to save up to live the cheapest life possible.  i get that answer when it gets to any  a job.  i could literally switch jobs and  but that's unsustainable and the world is becoming more and more technological with the years.   the only regret for me would be that if the ai truly skyrocketed in an utopian scenario and  maybe i would be unable to afford to be immortal if i chose to be a poor bum.   any advice? take it easy on me and  if i can ask for that.   have a nice day :)

i live down a country lane,i can't ride so i am posting on reddit.   i always thought i washed her well but  so many areas have rust .  i am going to leave the forks for a week and then hopefully wheel her out and give a blast with the hose .  then do an entire coat of acf50 to hopefully protect her.   i do not commute anymore so she'll stay in the dry and  however i live down a country lane and year around it's covered in dirt and  i am sure this hasn't helped with bits of corrosion.    main concern the oil pipes are rusting again and  the coolant has gone from max to min over 2 years and  no evident leaks though i am thinking this might be normal?.  i have had to take the clutch slave off and will replace seals as i had lost half my master reservoir and  opened up the slave cover and there were crystals growing inside!  and hopefully it will be fine   rear brake pads and tyre and  and sprockets+chain to be renewed once i can get the front wheel on and lean her forwards  how often do others take the fairing off to clean? would you say she is in alright condition .   i do prefer my vfr and  i sometimes fantasize about a bmw gs but i know i could never give up the v4.  maybe one day i will upgrade to the crossrunner but for now i do not mind leaning forwards :d

i live in a regional city of about 50 thousand and not a major city and unemployment rate one of the highest in the state,is anyone else in a similar position?       it would literally take me about half an hour to write up a pretty basic cover letter but there is some huge ass mental wall that is preventing me from doing it? it's prefer i am interpreting it as the hardest task in my life.   i constantly pull out my cover letter word document and  stare at it for 30 seconds and  then just leave it till i turn the computer off.   is it sad that i actually tried modafinil  back say 8 months ago and  to actually try and write this cover letter? 8 months later and  still have not wrote it.       my only guess is that my situation plays into part.  i live in a regional city of about 50 thousand and  not a major city and  unemployment rate one of the highest in the state.  you vs 500 other people applying for jobs here.  i've just lost hope which adds to my depression and depletes my drive to move forward in life.  mentally it has taken its toll on me and  when you are stuck in a massive depressive unemployed cycle for 1. 5 years and feel prefer you can't get out of it.  also anxiety as well and  being socially isolated has messed me up in some sense to the point i've probably developed symptoms of social anxiety over the past 4 years.       and just imagine if i did get employed and  the transition could be so overwhelming i would probably slip into another depressive/anxious episode.  literally at a dead end here

i live have gone out of business,~tldr: my list is at the bottom and  after my rant~  i used amazon in the title because that’s the primary place where i do my shopping for horror ebooks.  well and  the only place and  since i have a kindle.  i do prefer browsing the horror sections in used book stores  and  but a lot of the indie used book stores where i live have gone out of business recently and  which sucks and  because there’s nothing prefer snatching up a vintage horror paperback with kickass cover art for $3.    anyway and  i don’t just browse the kindle horror section page by page and  because it pisses me.  the reason for that is 1. ) 7/10 books they feature are by one of four authors and  only one of whom isn’t  a total hack: anne rice and  v. c.  andrews and  dean koontz and  and of course and  stephen king.  i prefer king and  but i read most of his good/great books by the time i started college and and  though i admire his success and  i somewhat resent his utter dominance of the horror genre.  he’s not the only good horror writer out there and  and i’m also tired of seeing “top 10. ” lists on which five of the entries are one of his famous books.  making matters worse and  there are at least 2 brazen pieces of shit who also go by the name of stephen king and  but with an added middle initial–stephen r.  king and  for example.  i wish a painful and  drawn out death for this scamming bastard.  it’s pretty obvious his books are not the “real deal” and  but they still show up frequently when i’m browsing and i know for a fact tons of dumbass readers fall prey to his deception.  the fact that amazon allows him to continue selling his shitty ripoff books is infuriating and  too.    moving on and  the other 3 books out of 10 they show seem nearly always to be some self published kindle unlimited horror title that my gut tells me is probably trash.  and the horrendous cover art of these books doesn’t help either.  maybe i’m being prejudiced and  but i’m not going to change and  either.  i hate seeing these books pop up on every page and i also hate the fact that books by lesser known but much more talented authors never show up at all and  or you only see them past page 100 and  and my patience never holds out that long.    these vastly underrated authors include:  1.  david j.  schow–by far the best “splatterpunk” author there ever was and  and one of the most uniquely talented prose wizards in the genre.  his stories are insanely twisted and disturbing and  but always with an underlying intelligence.  his ebooks can all be bought on the cheap and  i think.  i’d recommend starting with his award winning collection “seeing red”.  the last story will make your jaw drop and  i guarantee it.     2.  dennis etchison–you might have heard of him and  but maybe not.  he’s regarded as one of the best short story writers of the last 40 years in the genre.  nothing he does fits into the standard horror tropes we’re all used to.  he’s definitely more on the side of “unsettling/disquieting” horror than shock horror and  prefer schow.  but he comes just as highly recommended.    3.  s. t.  joshi–not an author of fiction himself and  but a scholar and anthologist.  particularly and  he is the premier lovecraft scholar in the world.  he can be a bit sharp tongued and  but he knows his shit so i tend to buy his critiques no matter how acerbic they are.  any of his lovecraft anthologies are absolutely worth buying and  as are his purely academic works on lovecraft and “weird fiction”.    4.  brian hodge–he essentially writes in the same vein as schow and  but with a little more restraint.  he frequently appears in anthologies by.   5.  ellen datlow–one of the best and most prolific anthologists out there.  her editing instincts are almost always on point and  though i tend to enjoy her themed anthologies–haunted and  inferno and  lovecraft’s monsters and  darkness and  the monstrous–better than her “year’s best” anthologies and  though those are still worth reading.    6.  michael shea–usually sets his stories in the “mythos” universe and  but they are very much his own unique brand of twisted art.  “fat face” is his most famous story.  i’m getting tired so i’ll cut it short there.  just read him.    7.  mark samuels–another “mythos” writer and  but also a devotee of other past horror masters prefer poe and machen and  and his work has their influence written all over it–but prefer shea and  he never comes off as a copycat or a pale imitator.    8. ) caitlín r.  kiernan–i believe she is a professional anthropologist or geologist or something prefer that and  and her accumulated knowledge in those fields informs and enhances her stories prefer no other author i’ve seen.  her stories are incredibly well written and seriously weird and  too.  i’m about spent now so i’ll just end it by saying that her story “in the water works” ”–is that a great title or what?–which closed s. t.  joshi’s penguin anthology “american supernatural tales”. well and  it’s a goddamn masterpiece.  read it.     and  that joshi anthology i mentioned above? best anthology i’ve ever read and  and i collect those kinds of books prefer i’m expecting them to fund my retirement some day.  if you get one book from my list and  make it that.    the end!
i live in the heart of the midwest and where progressive changes prefer this tend to lag way behind the elite coastal cities in being implemented,saw an article in the nyt last week about this.  it’s a growing trend in nyc too.  lots of restaurants there are doing away with straws.  definitely a good move that’s hard to argue with and  though i must say and  i do prefer my plastic straws and  especially bendy straws.  yes and  i know that is childish of me and  but most people have a few childish habits they don’t grow out of and  right?   i live in the heart of the midwest and  where progressive changes prefer this tend to lag way behind the elite coastal cities in being implemented.  now and  a lot of times that is not a good thing  and  but in this case and  i feel it is.  i highly doubt quik trip  will be foregoing the use of plastic straws and  of which they have about a dozen varieties and  anytime soon. 
i live better than the majority of the world i should be so happy," . com/219424711 [bad quality] i found this segment pretty interesting and ironic.  those two are runway slaves and i found this conversation to be one of natalism at it's finest.  i understand this is not real at all but it is based on a true story as they say.  wanted to know what you guys think.  i do not want to get too into detail right now because i am a bit in a rush right now.   also what do you guys think about the pejorative term  and slavery in general.  to me this a big reason why i find myself agreeing with antinatalism.   in a world were you are literally forced into labor and  scourged and  and are deemed property they voluntarily wanted to pass on their seed to preserve life and revolt.   well maybe they did not.  it seems humans just have babies well cause it feels good.   it's a desire met.  sex feels good.  i do not blame them for that aspect of it.  i want sex too but to have a baby? seems prefer that is more of a construct to me.  social conditioning.   i mean how else could i have come to this conclusion if i had what they say they have.  prefer and  friends and  a good life.  a reason to live.  there's no way.   the human will to live is truly fascinating.  it's also fascinating how if you do not have a will to live you are essentially shamed and made less than.  it's good stuff it really is.   humans are smart they know it feels bad to be a pariah.    humans take pride in making others feel worse for their sake.  it gives them great pleasure to have control.   all because you do not fit the norm.  i get it.  whats a world without rules and guidelines.  chaos.  we can't have that.  we need production.  it's work or die.   i find it intriguing that humans have the capacity to reason but come to conclusions that slavery is acceptable.  of course not everyone agreed but who does right.  the majority did not seem to care.  the ones profiting did not seem to care.  the idea that life is good despite the suffering it's  truly remarkable.   perhaps i am an ignoramus.  hell what do i know anyways i ought to do what they say and not say a peep? for what choice do i have? you see i prefer taking orders and being a good boy to society.  it gives me great pleasure to be part of the pack.  be a part of a nation.   people give me validation cause i do what i am supposed to do.  it makes me happy.  that is what life is all about.  taking orders from folks and receiving treats for it.  i prefer it.   i prefer the world for forcing a cruel world upon me.  how could i not? i have internet and i surf reddit.  i live better than the majority of the world i should be so happy.  there's so much joy in the world right?  i am so happy to be alive.  there's nothing wrong with being born right?   'man is the only slave.  and he is the only animal who enslaves.  he has always been a slave in one form or another and  and has always held other slaves in bondage under him in one way or another.  in our day he is always some man's slave for wages and  and does that man's work; and this slave has other slaves under him for minor wages and  and they do his work.  the higher animals are the only ones who exclusively do their own work and provide their own living.  -  mark twain"
i live in with all the progress,it  blows my mind that people believe life is so great that it just completely usurps the alternative.  i know i’m beating a dead horse here but is life really necessary? prefer we are all going to die one day and nothing we do or did will have actually mattered unless you know you’re famous.     i mean do you have to live in this world? i know it’s been forced on you but do you have to bring other people into it?  is it really worth the negatives? is life really that good to you? don’t get me wrong i enjoy my life but i also hate my life too very much so.  even though i feel prefer my life is “ok” it’s prefer i could do without it.   is it worth the burden of waking up every day if you have to overcome the dread/drudgery of existing too?   prefer if i vanished tomorrow in my sleep i wouldn’ be mad of course i couldn’t have any emotion so that’s a moot point.  but idk what i’m trying to say i guess i just see the degree of negativity is still too high for me even in a first world i live in with all the progress we have made as humans.  if i can’t wake up smiling and excited then i know i’m fighting an uphill battle today which is basically everyday. 
i live in the comfortable first world,the joys and pleasure are great in life don’t get it twisted we’re not saying those aren’t great things to live for but this is about birth.  i get pleasure but it’s not sufficient to change my world view.    no birth no need for pleasure/no pleasure.  no birth no suffering.   the suffering that takes place is not offset by the greatness of pleasure  in life.     that’s what we believe .   we believe it’s far too steep of a price to pay even if one person has a horrible malevolent death versus 10 euphoric lives most of us would say no.    i don’t think the struggle or suffering  of life is offset by pleasure plus seeing how meaningless life can be and the fact that we are all going to die makes you really wonder why go through any pain?    i’m sorry i don’t and i live in the comfortable first world and i’m still saying that so imagine how it must feel for those who have it worse.

i live nowhere near north dakota in real life and so what could this dream possibly mean,i actually had this dream a few days ago and  so i do not think it had anything to do with veterans day.   &#x200b;  in my dream and  i was on a normal commercial airliner and  i guess with some people that i was traveling with for work.  i do not remember where the flight started and  but the flight did not end on land.  as we were in the sky and  the plane landed in the clouds that were somehow solid enough to sustain our weight.   &#x200b;  i learned that the united states had a military base here and  which was cool.  i got off the plane with all these people to explore this land in the clouds.  despite the elevation and  the place actually felt pretty normal.  i felt no signs of altitude sickness or anything prefer that.   &#x200b;  i went into a large store that was prefer a post exchange or a commissary.  i asked one of the cashiers where we were and  and she said the nearest city on land was called abilene church and  nd.  my dream ended there and  and when i woke up and  i went on the internet to find that no such place exists.  i live nowhere near north dakota in real life and  so what could this dream possibly mean?

i live in an otherwise beautiful apartment complex and but there ’ s always one person who ruins it for everyone else,i live in an otherwise beautiful apartment complex and  but there’s always one person who ruins it for everyone else.  she’s your typical food-stamp collecting overweight whale who’s claimed every disability in the book to get as much money as she can from the government.  our apartment has a strict “no pets” policy and  but they’re required to make exceptions for service animals.    she got ahold of this big ass dog somehow and  and now there’s huge shit patties everywhere i look when i go outside.  sometimes it barks really loudly at 6am in the morning as well and  and prevents me from getting enough sleep.  i hate the damn thing and  and she claims that it’s a doctor-prescribed “comfort animal” and  but it sure is making my life a whole lot more uncomfortable.  i talked to my landlord and  but she said her hands are tied since it’s technically a service animal.  i really wish i could make it disappear.

i live a sedentary lifestyle,what could this possibly mean? is there a name for this condition? i am a relatively healthy 27-year-old american male.  this has been going on for some time; i have no idea when it started.  i am 6'0'' tall and weigh 165 pounds.  i eat correctly and  although i live a sedentary lifestyle and do not really exercise.   about once every hour  and  i have this slightly painful swelling feeling in my heart.  on a pain scale of 0-10 and  it's probably only a 1.  it comes out of nowhere and  lasts for maybe two seconds and  and then goes away.  it's prefer my heart skips a beat or something.  this happens when i am sedentary and  i. e.  sitting perfectly still.  i might expect this feeling while exercising and  but it happens when i am in front of the computer.   i do not know what this condition is called and  or even whether there's a name for it.  i looked up heart murmur and heartburn and  but neither seems to describe what i am experiencing.  it just feels prefer my heart is pumping blood extra hard for two seconds and  and then goes back to normal.  what i am really afraid of is that these are mini-heart attacks that might one day lead to a real one.  is that what's going on here? is my body trying to warn me of something?

i live in guilt,for instance and  she buys herself tea a lot from starbucks and such and  and the one time years ago that she got me something from there and  i tried to show very clearly how excited and happy i was.   and yet it never happens again.   but with things prefer food and  she will make an effort to get the things i prefer and  if i tell her .        i just wish she would actually notice what i do prefer and  so i do not have to directly ask for it.   itd be nice to be surprised sometimes with something i prefer.   instead what she does is surpise me with things she hope's ill prefer and  and then is extremely disappointed when i do not and  so much that i live in guilt when i disappoint her.         that said and  its not certain that she's a narcissist and so take my experience with that in mind. 
i live in constant depression,definitely.   but sometimes it feels prefer i break things in one state of mind and  but the next day its repaired itself and well and  its prefer i worry i am just forming a separate self without really being my true self and ever evolving from it and  if that makes sense.   prefer i can never be true enough to myself to make any lasting changes and  and that is  why i feel prefer i am forcing my femininity instead of it coming naturally--and then i get depressed because the developmental stages of my brain are over and  and maybe ill never be able to become as feminine as i could be.   well i mean and  maybe i want to be female because i simply prefer feminine things.  and lately i see all these posts on other sites about  and i wonder if that is all i want.   but then i also have the genital dysphoria and  and that makes me feel  but also validated that i really want to be a girl and  nsfw ahead and  that i would try to push my testicles up their inguinal canals and my penis inside me and  and it felt comfortable.   but then i wonder if its because when i was really young and  i shared a bath with my neighbor friend that was a girl and  is a girl and  and that i somehow just wanted to know what it was prefer having the parts she had.   and i have always had this habit of simply copying other peoples behaviors.  as much as my parnaoia makes me feel ive caused my parents to become copies of me and  i also feel prefer i am copies of them.   and so if i just was trying to be a copy of my female neighbor and  then i tell myself i am transitioning for the wrong reasons.  that i am not being my true self and  and that somewhere when i was really young i lost the way to being comfortable in this body as it is.   and i am sure many transphobes would readily encourage me for that line of thought and  and that many trans people would readily discourage me from that line of thought and  and then i am left not knowing whats true and what is not.     in truth and  i am just afraid.   transition is scary.   but what i fear a lot as well and  is aging.   and womens skin seems to age worse than men.  as well and  being weaker is scary.   i am afraid of having softer thinner skin and  and worry i wont be able to be comfortable with it.   but i also know that testosterone literally causes men to die earlier than women and  so there is that.   and as well and  the feeling that despite what hrt changes and  i am left with what hrt cant change and  and i live in constant depression because of that and  constantly being reminded of that with my reflection and my voice.   and voice training will never be sufficient and  i just know it.    as well and  sometimes women just sicken me.  my mom especially.   but men sicken me too.   the way my mom uses her voice to make our dogs feel happy and  it makes me sick with envy and disgust.   but i know our male dog doesnt really buy it and  prefer and  even though he gets happy at her persuasive voice and  i think he sees past it.   but then i think and  will i be persuadable in that same way once i get srs? will i really be nothing more than a castrated man?  i mean yes and  ill be on hrt and  but there's still that ineffable quality of womanlyness  that i worry ill never be able to possess and  to be.   i am constantly jeaous of how women are and  but never really aware of if i am being it myself.    and all that.   yeah its probably nothing and  but its hard to know.   and if i did have womans intuition and  surely mine is all clouded and ruined by me always doubting myself and trying to force myself to think differently and  and i worry ive traumatized myself to such an extent that there is no going back from it and  just learning to live with it the way i have to learn to live with what i cant change about my body.    i mean ive tried to walk on water haha and  have not succeeded .   well one reason i am sad is the regret--i let the black and white thinking consume me and  where i just look at my body and see testosteronization.   even if i see a cis woman with a hand to face ratio the same as mine and  or arms to torso ratio as long as mine and  it still is not always enough to convince me that i can be feminine despite it all.   i think its this natural discomfort that i have with my body that i've defined as being too masculine and  but then i worry that my being trans altogether is wrong and that i am just uncomfortable being human in general and  but then i forget about all the other reasons i feel i am trans and  and so in that sense i get very emotionally reason based instead of seeing things full picture.     another reason i am not so healthy and normally functioning as everyone else is that i am pretty paranoid of things all the time and  and it started around three years ago.   paranoid that humans are psychic and  but my paranoia leads me down a rabit hole of the world revolving around me and i and  very literally and  get these god complex feelings taht are hard to deal with.  i see synchronicity and coincidences everywhere and  and while trying to parse out what are meanings created by my brain filling in the gaps and what are actually scary  coincidences and synchronicities and  i well and  i never can make any sense of it all and  and end up going crazy wishing there were some men in black or something that would come and give me answers and  but i am also aware of how tin-foil hat it all sounds so i try to keep myself in check.   in other words i walk a line between what would be labelled neurotic and psychotic and i stress myself out.    something that makes me most paranoid is that ive somehow caused people to become clones of me and  psychologically and  and i feel it when i see people using the same manners of speech that i used and  and i fear ive somehow caused everyone to be prefer me and  and its agh.    as well and  i appreciate the compliments and  i really do and  but if i am to get high on myself for a moment and  i have to say that if i can be insightful and  i can also end up being insightful into really dark thoughts and hopeless feelings.   prefer how science might reveal things that we do not want to be revealed--such as how i feel my developmental period is over--altho the brain still retains its plasticity and  to some extent and  beyond those developmental periods--and perhaps science is only researching modern culture and not enough research has gone into people who are able to unlock and shape those earlier years of development--and my goal is not to try and become male and  but rather and  to undo all the male socialization that i got and replace it with femininity and  unashamed femininity--but then feminism has made me feel that a lot of what i feel is femininity is simply submissiveness and  and then i get hopeless again because i either feel too domineering and  or too submissive and  and never really real.

i live inside somber moods with sad songs when i am feeling sad,its hard to describe.  its prefer i know people are trying to convince me of how to be a man and that i just need to do this and that and then ill be able to prefer myself and prefer others.  and i kindof live in that space where i prefer that people are trying and i can always deny them.  but actually transitioning and  nope and  i cant do that.  for some reason i would rather be in this inbetween where i dream of being a girl but never letting it become reality.   as my dad said and  maybe i just prefer being sad.  i honestly think he's right.   i  fall and winter to spring and summer by far.  i live inside somber moods with sad songs when i am feeling sad.  sometimes i listen to sad music to make myself sad.   i am too afraid of anything real and  so i live where i cant be defined.   its dumb and  its comfort and  yet not.   i hate it but its me and  in a way.

i live in the central standard time zone,ive put it off for weeks.  i missed the last appointment that mightve earned me a letter of approval to get back on hormones and  which i would been gatekept from despite being on them for ~3 years.   and now i am too anxious and procrastinating to even call and set up another appointment and  and thinking about going fills me with dread when i let myself be real about it.   and they're closed on the weekend and  which sucks and  i shouldve called today.     so i need to call monday and was wondering if someone could remind me and push me to do it even though i am so avoidant.   seeing all my acne coming back and more facial hair growing in than i ever had before is literally hell.   and yet i still manage to detach myself from my feelings enough to not care and  ill find a way to not be bothered and ignore the acne and the dysphoria because it comes in waves anyway.   i need help  edit to add: i live in the central standard time zone
i live with my boyfriend in a house we just started renting a month ago and and he is overwhelmed by being the only one employed,today was my first day at my new job and i did not go because i had an extreme panic attack.  i took 2 xanax and knocked myself out for 5 hours.  i am on lexapro and  which is an antidepressant and  but i don’t feel it working anymore.  i’m extremely depressed again and feel hopeless.  i live with my boyfriend in a house we just started renting a month ago and  and he is overwhelmed by being the only one employed.  i have sought out therapists and psychiatrists in the past and  and have plans to start again tomorrow with that and set an appointment.  however and  i feel prefer it’s gotten to the point where if i don’t overcome this issue soon and  he might leave me and  or we will lose our house.  he really dislikes his current status at his job and wishes to step down.  it is hurting me that he feels this way and i don’t want to burden him with my struggles.  i want our relationship to work and  and i want to get better and be able to work.  i don’t have much experience and  and my options job wise is mostly retail and  which is terrifying to me to think that i have to deal with so many different people a day.  i’m 22 years old and  and don’t think i could even get disability if i tried.  i am at a loss on what to do with myself anymore and the suicidal thoughts have returned.

i live with my aunt uncle and cousins,i've always been antisocial and i was okay with it and  but i am about to turn 21 and i have nothing in life.  no license no job and i have serious problems with my teeth.  my parents died when i was young my mom committed suicide.   i live with my aunt uncle and cousins.  i have a sister she is currently in graduate school. 
i live with my aunt and uncle nice people but bad parents i am trying to teach myself how to be an adult at 21 i am a fucking loser right now,let's face it mom my childhood was bad and you're one of the reasons why.  you married dad when you were young and had two kids me and my loser sister.  for reasons i do not know dad became addicted to drugs and in the end was shot by a police officer when i was around four.  you did not take this well.  you dated one guy afterwards but that also ended badly.  you became addicted to muscle relaxers.  of course you could not handle them.  i remember you shoving your head in the microwave and stove i do not know if you were tired or trying to kill yourself in front of us because of your fucked up life.  now that i write it you were trying to kill yourself you were that type of person to do it in front of us.  i do not blame you for it though life sucks.  grandpa came in the door and saw you acting all fucked up and took me and my sister to his place.  i came back home the next day and you had already committed suicide i was eight.  i did not learn until middles school that you killed yourself i realized it myself i am a slow learner.  i've always been the type to shut myself in and this certainly did not help.  my grandparents died as well my grandma in between eighth and ninth grade and grandpa in tenth.  i honestly do not remember school i showed up put my head on the desk and slept i did that everyday through highschool and middle school.  if you asked me to remember more than five names i would have to think about it.  it always surprised me when someone else remembered my name.  i know i am bitching mother but you're going to have to sit through it.  the worst part is that my grandfather tried to connect with me he tried to make me see a psychologist and talk to me he was very worried i think he my cousin chad and my friend ben are the only people who consistently in life tried to connect with me.  i am sorry i let him down.  he was diagnosed with depression before he died he was just old.  i've graduated highschool and have done nothing with my life since it's been two years.  i am in online college classes now and doing well but i am not learning anything their easy.  i live with my aunt and uncle nice people but bad parents i am trying to teach myself how to be an adult at 21 i am a fucking loser right now.  i have a sister and she's nice but i do not know if i prefer her it sounds petty but when she annoys me or touches me i want to break her arm.  i have boundaries and she breaks them i know she's not doing it maliciously but i do not care she's going to get hurt one day.  from me blowing up and screaming at her i am usually very quite.  i do not think i prefer her i need to start my life and i do not have much support so i will use her and her husband but if they died tomorrow i would be annoyed that my sister died not that she specifically died i won't cry over it either my life would move on.  i am scared that i will never connect with anyone and never marry which is a real possibility.  i think i want kids but not sure.  i am going to add more to this later and talk about my problems but right now i am tired from my sister waking me up and only going to get three hours sleep.

i live alone and far away from a family that is the source of most of my broken patterns,i am a neet because :  1.  i dropped out of college 4 times  and  mostly because of motivational issues.  2.  i lost most of my jobs because i can't manage my social phobia and  fear of my superiors and my own pressure to be perfect.   about 18 months ago and  my narcissistic injuries in need for approval whispered to me that maybe i was a gifted person.  i had so low self-esteem i just became obsessed by the delusion of being a genius whose talent was misunderstood.  i already knew at that time i was not one and  but i just forced myself into an intellectual mold and  trying to read philosophy and learn new languages and  while learning programming and drawing and a shitload of things i do not care anymore.  anyway and  i was not able to finish any book i took at the library nor i was able to improve any talent.  eventually and  i would hit a wall and ask myself why i was not able to reveal my 'gift' .  i did not knew at that time i was only hiding a broken tortured add personality   behind a shell of inhibition and self-control.   so yeah and  i've only been diagnosed add 7 months ago and  at 21 years old and  after almost 21 years of feeling alienated from my surroundings.   since then and  my life did not get any better.  it sounds negative and  but i consider i have no choice but to go through a desert.  i was in the middle of semester at school.  i was very motivated at the beggining and  but after that illusion faded out and  i realized my career choice was the worst i could have done.  i mean it : the worst ever possible for an add  person.   this was a career choice my fears made me do to ensure a salary and a steady environment for my social phobia.  after one semester and  even vyvanse could not make me motivated to do anything.  i was nauseous just thinking about the 2 and a half remaining years in this ugly school with people that do not match any of my interests.    4 months ago and  i started going crazy with an impulsive and agressive behavior.  i was destroying a lot of things  not even realizing that it was side effects from vyvanse.    my second semester started.  i stopped taking my meds and  and ended up depressed/suicidal.  i wanted to cancel my semester but my father put me pressure and gave me insane amounts of money just so i could concentrate on my studies.  fear of deception made me delay the moment i cancel my semester and  and finally i just ended up dropping out too late.   i should have opened my heart and just be honest with my parents.  it would have been less painful for everybody.   3-2 months ago and  even though i stopped vyvanse and  i continued being very agressive and impulsive and spent all the money my father gave to me.  i already decieved him so i could not careless.  i also have a ton of resent against him.    1 month ago and  i started celexa  and  for my anxiety issues and they made me so zombielike.  actually and  the effects were pretty strong really fast.  first week and  i just decided i would dress the way i want so i bought the weirdest clothes.  i shaved my head and started walking around the city and  just looking people in the eyes and being proud of not feeling panicked for wearing a weird cap in public.  second week and  the effects would vary a lot and  going from extatic to suicidal and  and i still was very tired and  sleepy and lost in my add thoughts.  they effects tended to work better after the second week and  but i still was unable to use any willpower.  could not wake up in time to go see my friend in quebec and  even though he paid me for the travel.    the great thing on celexa is that i was not experiencing any agressivity anymore.  those meds also helped me go through a easy 31 nofap streak.  i also started looking for jobs and even got one and  but on my first day and  i experienced a weird panic attack on the way to work and called to say i changed my plans.    recently and  i decided i would reduce my antidepressants dosage and  because i do not want to experience a painful withdrawal on a long-term period and   and i need some energy back to actually get a &?%$ job! so and  my anxiety came back  but i feel complety wrecked.   this is how i became a neet again.    so and  here i am today.  my parents won't help me anymore with money.  i deserved this and  but i have 5$ left right now and debts growing fast and  so it's pretty rough.  i need to go away from the source of my broken behavioral patterns and  create my own social life and  not leaning only on my past.   i can't even count how many times i became a neet.  one sure thing is that it means nothing good to me.  still and  being a neet has it's advantages.  a lot of time means a lot of freedom and opportunities to improve anything.  but that comes with a good situation and a good mindset.   so and  for me and  it is not a nice life.  i also have to pay my food and my rent but i have less than 5$ in my bank account right now.  i live alone and  far away from a family that is the source of most of my broken patterns.    sorry for the overwhelming negativity and  but that's my life as a neet right now.   i am going to get this life back on track and  find a job.  use that nevrotic energy for some money.  use that money for art supplies and  good food and doing shit with people i prefer.  be patient.  full time work means part-time art and  and a lot of discipline.  part-time job means more dedication into art and the same huge amount of discipline.  but mostly and  what i want first is to keep socially connected to people.  they keep me sane.  they give me confidence.  they give me purpose to live and prefer.  i have a lot of time ahead of me and  and i can easily save hours and hours of meaningful time by cutting internet connection. 
i live in a dead-end town where every road leads to mediocrity and that makes it hard for me to justify taking a single step in any direction,i figured i would look here for some outside perspective as nearly everyone who frequents has either been in my shoes or is in them.   to preface i think alot of other neets have it alot worse than me.  i have been brought up into a decent family and  a boring calm neighborhood and  have little issues socializing by nature even if it is a bit forced and  and i am juuust mentally gifted enough to be able to confidently say my choices are alot dumber than i am.  i just  dealt with a few traumas badly and ended up shutting down and phasing out of society for a few years after highschool.  the people and family i know no longer really connect with me on any level and i find their company a good bit less entertaining than sitting on a computer to the point where socializing is always forcing myself to go do it and  and 80% of the time i regret it.   i am just about 22 and am more or less past the pits of depression and  but since i was 16 i  just decided hey i could die tomorrow from anything and  so i will live comfortably and do only what i want.  and its really hard to break that pact.  i think what i need are not routes other have taken but definitive things that all neets should do to get to a real and better life.  i live in a dead-end town where every road leads to mediocrity and that makes it hard for me to justify taking a single step in any direction.    i look around at the potential jobs and lives i could have and they fill me with existential dread even if .  i do not want to be my neighbors and  my parents and  my friends and  but you can only be content with neetdom for so long.  and reintroducing myself to society with a shitty job i do not want just to save money to move away and get introduced to a whole new set of challenges is the most realistic move for me and  but comparing all that potential stress and failure to the invisible rewards from it always just leaves me stuck.   i've been recommended working from home and that's probably the worst one i get and  prefer its miserable sitting at home alone all day as it is so attaching daily unfun time to my comfort station  feels prefer such a step backwards to my messed up spoiled brain.   what options are there for people prefer us? do i just need to condition myself to be able to endure stress/pain/failure etc.  for the chance that things work out?   sorry for the paragraphs i've always been the type to write to vent and it just spills out.  and shit i will take advice from anyone willing to listen and  you do not have to be a former neet per-say.  thanks

i live with my parents and and i am spending all day at home with my mom in a somewhat isolated rural area,i finished university almost one and a half year ago and am struggling to get a job.   i live with my parents and  and i am spending all day at home with my mom in a somewhat isolated rural area.  this is creating attrition between us.    i've threatened to leave the house after we had a fight this week.  she said; then leave.  i stayed after she cried and said sorry though.   but i can't stand living here anymore and  man.  having to stay here with no privacy or boundaries is destrying my soul as i age.   and so i put effort in a post as a freelance writter in one of these sites.  i prefer writing.  i thought it would be perfect.  i even created a blog to show my texts and the different styles and genres i am able to create.   after finally registering on the site and  i found out most of the jobs there are not about writing at all.  they want you to sell useless products and act prefer you are a specialist.    so you have to look up things prefer why marshall amplifiers are different from fender ones in detail and  and the next job is about why a make up brand is better than another one.  and blog all these completely different things informally in the first person using retarded techniques prefer a salesbitch.   i submitted to some projects and  got the jobs and felt raped trying to market things i do not care and never heard about.   spending hours trying to learn things about radio signals and frequencies and the best equipments to capt them.  then make posts explaining and selling each of them.    and after that and  study another weird random technical bullshit about refrigerators to sell them and  for another client.  and so on.    i've been crying all day because i do not know what to do now.  i invested so much on this emotionally.  i thought i would finally have money to put gas in my car and buy healthy food.   have any of you tried to work as a freelancer on these sites and apps that offer you the chance to meet clients?  how to get jobs that do not make you feel prefer you are being raped but still having to smile and say it feels good.   marketing and selling things we hate got to be worse than hell.  i do not want to do it ever again and  god.   .   td;rl  live with parents and relationship with them is deteriorating.   want to get money after finishing university.   tried freelance writter job.  and it feels horrible because i have to sell random technical crap as if i were a specialist.   this requires too much time studying useless things prefer tips for lipstick brands or refrigerator components.   the pay is only enough to put gas in my car and buy healthy food.    i feel absolutely gutted right now with no hope because i thought this job would be my salvation.    what to do? it gets better as you get used? should i continue? what are your experiences?

i live in the netherlands,i live in the netherlands.  my max budget is around 250 euros.  i currently have an moto g 3.  i am not sure if a moto g5+32 would be that good of an idea.  i do not really know how stuff works with carriers.  i would prefer anothers android phone and  but the brand doesn't really matter.  i know jack shit about what makes a good phone.   i will mostly be using it for streaming video and  voice/text/video chatting and  browsing and  listening to music via earbuds and  and certain apps prefer those i use to learn japanese or read comics.  i mean that in that exact order and  video is the top priority.  i multitask quite a bit and  mostly browsing + music and  something that actually did not work well on my moto 1 which is why i am mentioning it.   ofcourse i need to be able to properly call people too but that's a given considering it's a phone.  if it's possible i would prefer to emulate 8 or 16 bit games on it but when i tried it with my old phone after rooting for controller use the input delay was so horrible that even if the performance was fine it was practically unplayable.  i am not willing to pay much for  this because my pc is great for emulating anyways.  this is of very low priority but would be very cool to have.  however and  i would definitely  a phone with the lowest input lag possible.  i never really did anything fancier with the root than trying adblock and the controller.    i would prefer to not have to worry about space and  right now with my 16 it feels a bit too little and  so i would prefer 32.  for music being able to use at least a 64 gig sd card would be important.  i am not an audiophile though likely just because i have shitty equipment.  i would prefer to be able to have more apps installed without it slowing down too much prefer now.  for watching my videos i think i would prefer a 1080p screen as opposed to my current 720 if that's possible.  i would  resolution over size.  i am fine with the size of my moto g3.  i definitely would not mind if it was a bit bigger though.  battery and charge time is important to me.  i would  a phone that lasts longer over one that properly emulates those old games.  i would  a phone with little to no forced bloatware.  i do not care much about photos or the camera at all as long as it's not complete shit.  i also do not care for regular phone games.   why am i changing aside from the phone being old? the current phone is being quite slow and  especially when typing in certain apps.  it can't seem to handle having all the apps installed i have installed so i think i would need more ram.   the microphone is atrocious and  people can often barely hear me and  yet other times the background noise is super loud and  sometimes to the point where they keep hearing themselves.     theone's buggy sometimes too and  where suddenly it starts to automatically input the suggestions you always see at the bar on top even though i turned off any autocorrect feature and  and then it randomly goes away.  i think there's too little space for apps with the 16  gigs.  my speakers are also starting to break.  lastly the battery time when using runs our quickly but that's probably because i did not know to take the charger out when it's done.  the slight input delay on the phone is pretty annoying too.  lastly and  i dislike the bloatware preinstalled with the thing i can't uninstall.

i live in the netherlands and have barely dealt with this culture and but it seems to have unique issues,that's true.  it seems to be a thing of both their economic situation and the culture they've created in it.  that's still sad to see and  because others here have typed neighborhoods of other races with low class people tend to be less bad.  that means the culture for plenty of low class black people is messed up somehow.  i live in the netherlands and have barely dealt with this  culture and  but it seems to have unique issues.

i live in a flatshare and i ca n ' t cook and so i rely on snacks to feed myself and eat just little enough so i do not have to spend so much money,same.  ever since i dropped out of college 2 years ago and  my life has been nothing but skating by.  i live in a flatshare and  i can't cook and  so i rely on snacks to feed myself and eat just little enough so i do not have to spend so much money.  i stay up late and sleep for 3-4 hours everyday before going to work.   everyone works hard and  while i am the laziest and spoiled piece of shit who relies on everyone else and is dependant.  i've never thought about the future and instead i spend my time playing video games or watching youtube.    the worst part is and  i do not feel prefer changing.  i would rather die than put effort into anything and  since it's easier to die than deal with all of it.  i constantly read about redditors who have been in the same place prefer me and  but turned their lives around.  i am  envious and  but at the same time i do not do anything about it.    i am waiting just until someone stops supporting me and  since i can't cut everyone off just prefer that and then find some way to kill myself or hurt myself badly.

i live dirt poor,i spent 3. 5 years getting a degree immediately after high school and  painstakingly passing courses and working hard.  it got me debt and entry into an extremely competitive and unopportunistic job market.   i am always working hard in the long term.  i have savings and investments but i live dirt poor and  constantly giving 70% of my money to rich landlords.  why are you assuming you know me and  you do not know shit. 
i live vicariously through ice,i am a shut-in and i  live vicariously through ice and feel prefer i am socializing which helps the empty lonely feeling that consumed me.   we're also the same age and i can relate to him struggling to do the most basic of tasks and organization.   then there's the entertainment of watching him somehow fuck everything around him up and  the nonstop talking and  the lack of filter and seeing him basically put out every thought onto the internet.   then there's also the memes and the feeling of being part of a community.

i live in america and i know very little about norway but what i have heard is that scandinavian countries in general have a really nice welfare system,if you can handle a one year break go for it and  but it's still very risky.  one year can easily become 2 years or even more if you are not paying attention since time can fly extremely fast when you're taking it easy.  i live in america and i know very little about norway but what i have heard is that scandinavian countries in general have a really nice welfare system.   my advice is if you're going to take it easy and  start your vacation from everything with a goal in mind and  maybe something to do with self improvement or working on a project that you never had time to do since the grind takes up too much time and energy.  i can see this ending in one of three different ways.  either you would come back to the workforce refreshed and better than when you were there and  barely manage to drag yourself out of bed back into the world out of necessity and  or no return at all.

i live prefer this everyday sigh,that's exactly me telling my neighbours that i am working and trying to avoiding people that try to call me i live prefer this everyday sigh. 
i live with my younger siblings and parents,almost every household in my neighborhood owns a dog.  in the middle of the night sometimes and  i wake up because of constant barking from a neighbors dog.  sometimes during the day and  thank god it's not  much anymore and  but when one dog starts barking and  other dogs follow suit.  ugh.   i live with my younger siblings and parents.  my 19 year old brother adopted a couple of kittens a few months back.  i tried my hardest to convince him not to.  now and  we are dealing with a lot of fleas in our home.  we are trying best to get rid of fleas.  i wish we could also get rid of cats.   how about you? what are some ways that pets invade your life even when you are petfree?
i live with my younger siblings and parents and and they ' re okay,i live with my younger siblings and parents and  and they're okay.  thankfully they have not brought it up.  it's mostly my older half brother - every now and then i see him - and then apparently he's been discussing me with other people.    i stay away from family gestures as well because i worry about the same thing.  i do feel the same - that they do not want to talk to me or hug me.  on that that day i met with my older half brothers and  sis in law and  nephews and niece - as my oldest half brother was going to depart - he went to me and 2 youngest brothers to ask where my sister was so he could hug her.  'ah there she is'  and he went to her and  hugged her and  said farewell to her and left.  it felt a bit strange and rude as this obviously seemed prefer he was ignoring/did not care about me+2 younger brothers.  i mean and  even his sons  hugged and gave their farewells to me.  alas and  perhaps i am overanalyzing this as well
i live with my parents and 4 younger siblings and and i ' ve never lived on my own/rented,i am 26 years old and  cf and  and single.  i am debt free and  but i've  been unemployed for the past year.  i have about 5k left in my bank account.  i live with my parents and 4 younger siblings and  and i've never lived on my own/rented.  *fyi dad's a taxi driver and  family has debt and  live paycheck to paycheck.  i help with their bills.   i am happy with my life and  though.  i think people usually think i must be depressed and  i've had put people put me down saying i am not doing anything with my life and  etc.  especially my eldest brother 😑   i've had a good year and  however.  i've been looking for a job and  and hopefully i will find a suitable one soon.  but and  i am not miserable.  far from it actually.    *another fyi and  i was a pre-k teacher and  foreign language  last year and  annd i did not think anything in life could be more miserable and depressing.  coming home every evening and  i felt prefer crying.  i was always exhausted and  i gained 10lbs and  then lost 20lbs - which put me underweight for the first time in my life.  i caught a few colds throughout the year and  had mysterious health issues crop up *which were probably due to anxiety*.  the biggest relief of my life is when finally the school year ended.  i did not think anything could make me more cf than i already was and  but being a teacher did.    my older three half brothers were all married by the time they were 20.  eldest is 34 and  divorced and  has two sons and  and hates his job.  second eldest is 31 and  two  children.  third eldest is 29 and  one step son and  one daughter and  and another daughter on the way.   when comparing my life with theirs and other people my age and  i am pretty grateful with what i have.  sure and  my life is not perfect and  i' d prefer to have a job and  but i am genuinely happy. 
i live with my younger siblings and parents my brother has 2 cats and and now we ' re dealing with fleas being everywhere,fleas.  i live with my younger siblings and parents - my brother has 2 cats and   and now we're dealing with fleas being everywhere.  ugh. 
i live with my younger siblings and parents,i am a subscriber of childfree subreddit and  as i am childfree.  some individuals do go too far and  but mostly i can relate to a lot of people from that subreddit.  i do not relate to when people bring the topic up about their pets.  the very thing that annoys them about parents and society regarding children and  they are guilty of themselves with their pets.  i find it highly ironic how obsessive some of them are about their pets.   if you could not tell by now and  along with being childfree and  i am also petfree.  i prefer animals and children and  but in small doses.  i do not want to have or own one ever.  i was an elementary school teacher  last year and  and i just accepted a job offer to work as a therapist at an autism clinic where i will be working with autistic children .  i know enough about children to know that i do not want any.  i live with my younger siblings and parents. my brother adopted 2 kittens a few months go.  i tried hard to convince him not to get any.  we are now dealing with flea infestations in our home 😐 dogs and  cats and  whatever and  i do not want them. 
i live with autism clinics,so and  i have a b. a.  in psychology and a b. a.  in japanese.  i've never been an aba therapist and  but i am about to be one at an aba clinic .  from my understanding and  i will go through training the first/second week of working there- and that training is for me to be a rbt.  from what i've seen in the state i live with autism clinics and  you have to at least hold a bachelor's degree before they'd even consider you . 
i live in indiana,i do not think you did anything wrong.  if they told you that you would get health insurance and then tell you something different and  then that's their fault.  i think it's reasonable to ask for a dollar up. and the way they said they do not prefer drama. that is unprofessional and shows that they do not care much about their employees.   i am lucky where i just entered the aba field and th3 clinic i work at are nice.  health insurance and  dental and  vision and  401k and  short term disability insurance and   long term disability insurance and   critical illness insurance and  life insurance and  17 days pto and  at workinh 35 hours per week.  only been in this field for 3 weeks now. and i am not sure if it's just a rare occurrence in this field to get health insurance? i live in indiana

i live in northern california,i live in northern california.  i hang dry all of my laundry outside.   i just view it as so wasteful to tumble dry laundry when the sun and wind is right there.  even during the winter- i view the tumble dryer as a last resort.   i hang the clothes outside to dry as long as i can and  and if its still moist and  i hang it on triangle clothes hangers inside and  and the only things i tumble dry are by pajamas which i plan on sleeping in that night.   it is viewed as  to hang dry laundry and  something that poor people do.   only people who have backyards that are not visible from the street do it.   i did grow up very poor and  and do not see electricity as something you waste just because you can.     hang drying has a lot of advantages.  i  the stiffer feeling of hang drying over the floofy stuffed animal plush feeling of using a clothes dryer.   hang drying actually takes less time than using a dryer- since you do not have to spend time waiting for the dryer to finish and  it especially saves time if you live in an apartment complex or dorm and have to use a laundromat or shared dryer.   clothes will last longer if you hang dry it and  because laundry lint is actually your clothes fibers coming apart.  however and  hanging outside will cause your clothes to fade faster because of the sun.

i live in suburbia,although i live in suburbia and i do enjoy it.  suburbia really was a major waste of resources.   it is incredibly dependent on cheap oil.  cheap oil to heat individual homes with only a few people living in them and  and cheap oil in order to make long drives to get to the store and work.

i live in central california in a heavy wine producing area,and i lost $345 on my gazprom stock that i bought last october.   i am hoping it bounces back up.  the us is not russia's only oil customer you know.    i am not a big fan of these sanctions by trump.   trade wars can spark into real wars.   i really am starting to see real-life effects of these tariffs.   i live in central california- in a heavy wine producing area.  and wineries are reporting that they can't sell their wine to china and  and have to sell it at a lower price locally.   a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money because of these sanctions.  and its not just  who will lose big money.  regular people are going to lose a lot of money in stock portfolios and businesses.

i live on the west coast and maybe i ’ ll see a handful of new openings pop-up a week and in a major metropolitan area and once in a blue moon one with no experience required but preferred in which i could apply for,does the bls track jobs by new jobs created as per work required and  or by new entrants into the field? it seems that firms near-unanimously promote within and  from legal assistant to new paralegals.  what you didn’t mention is that growth amongst the genuinely entry-level support workers straddles around the national average.  it’s the phenomenon i hear about and  that firms are seeing legal assistants as cumbersome and are putting more of their workload onto paralegals.  it’s de facto impossible to go straight to paralegal now unless you are closely related to the attorney it would appear and  or possibly an  unemployed jd.  dying profession in that in reality it appears to be static and  whilst there is always the coming danger of automation at the attorneys convenience.  on top of this and  listings for legal assistant are usually specific about the specific legal field in which they require experience from.   so your own anecdote makes the rule? i live on the west coast and maybe i’ll see a handful of new openings pop-up a week and  in a major metropolitan area and  once in a blue moon one with “no experience required but preferred” in which i could apply for.  this holds true for many more on the internet.  maybe it’s different for you living in a smaller city where it’s somewhat easier to network and where you’re not competing with top-notch graduates and unemployed lawyers.   the contradiction is that legal assistant experience is near required to go to paralegal.  almost all of the legal assistant jobs require at least an associates degree and  so this increasingly renders paralegal studies certificates tedious and obsolete for the future.  i’ve also spoken to a few attorneys in the recent past and they have corroborated the preference for tangible college degrees.  which is what i heavily recommended to op and  degree over certificate. 
i live with my parents and most food and bills are covered by them,my concerted and  prolonged attempts at finding a stable part-time job in anything service and  retail and  fast food etc seem to have yet again fallen through.  the job market is awful where i live.  i’m nearly unemployable but that’s a different story.  i’ll just have to try again at the end of august.  anyways i am partially underemployed and  i only work a few shifts a month for a few hundred monthly 350-400 and  i get 250 for helping a friends business and  100 a month from donating plasma and the rest from student loans to pay off the most necessity expenses(insurance 200 and  gas 100 and  phone 100 paid for 2 months and  food 100 at most but my other real income will cover this.  i am a part time student only enrolled in 2 online courses and this is until my next loan installment.    i only need to budget this until august.  i live with my parents and most food and bills are covered by them.  i have no necessities beyond insurance and  gas and phone.    currently at 1 and 400
i live are not even aware women,>also as someone from a semi rural northern community and  it baffles me that there are women who make it to their twenties without at some point peeing outside   i am a guy and was frequently told that my ability to pee outside was a truly wonderful masculine ability denied to women and  so i would wager a good amount of the people where i live are not even aware women can pee outside in the first place. 
i live in connecticut right now and and my dream is to be able to move to someplace down south and preferably arkansas,i will give you guys/girls a quick rundown of my stats first: no friends and  ugly and  no job and  high-functioning autism and  intense social anxiety where i can barely leave the house and  paranoia.    okay and  now you know about me.  i just have a weird question that maybe some people have some experience with.  about three months ago i fell for the  meme.  i started on june 1 and have been coding about three hours a day every day for the last 3 months.  i've been doing a combo of codeacademy and  treehouse and  books and  colt steele's udemy course and  and free online materials.  i just finished the jquery section after learning the basics of html and  css and  and javascript.  i've honestly finally found something that i am pretty good.  i am absorbing and remembering the information and  am able to build pretty nice looking sites with different libraries and  etc and  etc.   so my question is and  how completely fucked am i in terms of being able to get a job doing this? i really do not want to move to someplace prefer silicon valley or a big city where i will be competing with other programmers with cs degrees.  i live in connecticut right now and  and my dream is to be able to move to someplace down south and  preferably arkansas.  at first i thought after a certain amount of studying it might be easier to get a job down there and  but there are probably so few programmers that they only take the ones with degrees.   are there any self-taught programmers here who can help? maybe you guys have some tips on what to have on a resume or a form of structured learning.  thanks in advance.

i live in the north east and rarely get any matches,from my experience and  .  i live in the north east and rarely get any matches.  i got drunk one night and  bought a month of tinder plus and  took some new good pictures and  and came to the realization that i am what is considered and   it was seriously prefer light and day.  where i would only get prefer two matches a week in connecticut and  i was getting anywhere from 2-5 a day in little rock.  and these were the types of girls i was into.  nerdy and  hipster and  short-haired chicks.  so and  yeah.  i think location matters slightly.

i live my life again and fix all the mistakes and wrong choices i have done so far,me too.  but instead of some awesome anime world or something and  i usually imagine i suddenly back to the time when i was little.  my parents still take care of me and think i am a kid who has potential.  and people are surprised that i am so smart.  i live my life again and  fix all the mistakes and wrong choices i have done so far.   it feels terrible when i wake up and realize that there's no way back.  that almost makes me want to kill myself.  i have never told this to anyone because wishing myself was still a kid is really a loser thinking and it definitely will worry my family.

i live with a parent and a mental wreck myself and see my young siblings succeed,i live with a parent and  a mental wreck myself and  see my young siblings succeed. i hate that i was sold a false dream of being able to find a job when i graduated and all i have is a unpaid internship on my resume in a field that requires atleast 3-5 years of experience. i freak out about my future on a daily basis too. you are not alone in this. alot of people are in the same spot you are. you can still change it though and  suicide won't help and probably hurt your family alot too. 29 is young and you still have alot of options and a degree in it is very good in the job market. i also have this constant case of regret.

i live right,"age: 28  sex: male  height / weight: 5'11"" / 170 lbs  race: white  i live right in the middle of lyme disease territory.  i pulled the whole thing off and trapped it.  it's still here and alive.  no remaining part is on my leg.  there is a small opening where it was feeding and i do not know how long it was there.  it was maybe less than a centimeter wide and black.   should i go to the doctor? i do not see any rash.   i do not remember seeing it last night when i went to bed.  i read that it needs to be attached for longer before the disease can transfer but that means i got it from in my room and not outside.

i live with my parents in a small condo,i am 28 years old and still in college.  i was a neet for a few years when i was younger but i am a year away from a ba in history which i am worried about since i am still not sure what i want to do.  i have no interest or passion in anything and i fear responsibility.   i have my permit but i do not have a car and i do not have time toi practice driving.  i've never been in a relationship since i have a dead libido and i do not feel anything.   i have no brothers or sisters and  no cousins my age.  i do not have any friends i see on a regular basis.   i live with my parents in a small condo.  we're essentially in poverty.  my dad has multiple mental disorders and sleeps 18 hours a day.  my mom works 45 hours a week and  commutes an hour one way and is so busty and  she has no life outside work and is severely depressed with a ton of autoimmune disorder.   i work an entry level job and i am on food stamps and medicaid.   i feel suffocated.  i have so much energy and desire to do  but i do not know what.  i hate being trapped in this tiny box of my life.  i want to grow up and get outside but i have no money or anything.   i feel prefer i am losing my mind.

i live with my parents and we do not have much money,thanks everyone.   meh and  i am between semesters and working 24 hours a week so during my time off and  i feel prefer a useless log.  i do not drive and i do not have much money and i am bummed about being all that and an undergrad at 28.   i will disclose that i have a form of schizophrenia that doesn't involve hallucinations and i am asymptomatic with medication.   so i am basically several years behind since i did not start treatment and return to college until i was 24.  i am still there since i was at a two year school for 3 years but i earned two and  two year degrees with a perfect gpa.  i am proud of that but i feel prefer i got nothing else going for me.   i live with my parents and we do not have much money.  i just want to graduate and  get a car and  get a better job and  get a home and grow up.

i live too far away from everything,honestly and  the truth is that i do not want a job.  i thought getting one would fix things for me but i would work 5/7 and cry 2/7 days a week.   i ended up losing my job due high anxiety.   in the end i just do not want to look for it anymore.  i can't handle people and  i live too far away from everything and i can't/do not want to get out of my bed.  if i could make money out of something i can do lying on my bed at least i would have food on my fridge.  but guess sucking at games and rolling joints aint jobs.  i do not know and  feel prefer i would have to start starving  to get up of my bed and even so i would not know what to do.  i just feel prefer a shitty parasite and  leeching out my grannys money   &#x200b;  i just do not know.  i do not want to do shit.  even go out to get real food

i live with my mom,i live with my mom.  after years of rejection and  i've given up looking for a real job  and  now spend my days watching procedural cop show reruns or all kinds of conspiracy videos on youtube.  my mom refuses to give me money to do anything else .  i do not even have a car to drive anywhere free .  as far as doing anything productive and  i have been practicing web design and  but i am not getting any better at it.  do not think i have a shot in that field and  especially given how competitive i hear it is.    future looks bleak.

i live on my moms crumbs,even weed.  i would prefer to hear stories honestly.  i do not know.   i am legitimately curious but i am also going to vent this here because i can't really talk to anyone i know.  you do not have to read it  -------  i am addicted to opioids despite being neet and having no income.  i live on my moms crumbs .  i do not get high and  she just gives me enough to feel normal.  she works a full time job to support her habit and pay  here at her parents house.  this supply is obviously inconsistent and as a result i spend a fair amount of time in withdrawals.  this is not a fucking life and  this is true hell.  i can't get a job because i will probably end up in withdrawals before i get my first pay check and  have to call in sick and lose the job.   me and my mother live with my grandparents.  we're both supposed to be getting kicked out next week because they're disgusted at our lack of accomplishments .  my mother just lost her full time job and my grandparents do not know yet.  we may actually be fucked and  as we both have a habit and from the looks of it we're both going to be withdrawing on the street next week.   you can imagine what  disappointment i am to my family.  i am only 18 and i prefer to *think* i can turn myself around at some point before it's too late and  but my family doesn't.  they are so incredibly disappointed in me for my lack of academic or working experience at this age.  they  expected me to live on my own by now.  since dropping out of high school effectively four years ago and  i've worked for 6 months and i could not stand it.  i hated myself and everybody else when i worked.  i do not prefer hating people.   besides that i've done quite literally nothing for 4 years.  i can never complete a project i start.  i do not really enjoy video games.  i play tf2 a fair amount but it doesn't feel very good.  it's just the only way i know how to force myself out of bed.  i definitely do not prefer movies or tv series and  my attention span and pea brain are both too small to follow plot lines.  i just watch youtube in bed and play tf2.  all day every day.  i interact with my grandparents as little as possible because i do not prefer how they make me feel.    nowadays i halfheartedly look for jobs in the hopes of getting them to reconsider kicking me out but for some reason i just can't get myself to commit to anything.  it's fucking scary sometimes.  hell is comfortable and i do not want to leave it.

i live at home,i've never talked about it to my family members and  but i am extremely self conscious about my man boobs and  and anyone can tell or point them out.  when i was a teenager i was really overweight and  i lost that weight but i still had boobs.  i would hunch over to hide my moobs and  growing into bad posture it took me years of stretching and pain to straighten out my back.  when i am in public all i can think about is my chest and  is anyone seeing my moobs? why did i get boobs bigger than most women's? why does no one else have this problem? i wish i just had regular fat guy boobs.   everything felt pointless and  i could never be or do anything i want because of manboobs.  school was hell because all i could focus on when 100% of the time was if anyone could see my man boobs and  and when people did point them out despite your best effort in hiding it and  that would crush you knowing everyone can see it anyway.    i dropped out of college when i was 20 near the end of my school year because i had a presentation for every class and  and standing up and trying to hide your man boobs while giving a presentation was just too hard.  without a reason to even be in school and having 3-4 presentations which are usually hell and  i dropped out.  now i live at home off the welfare of my parents but i am not doing it because i am lazy and  school was hell and  getting groceries from the store is hell and  going anywhere in public is uncomfortable and  i can't be myself in public because i have breasts and everyone knows it.   if i did not have moobs holding me back and  i would probably be a different person.     i really want surgery so i can move on and i do not want to ask my parents to pay for it because they do not really have much money and they're getting older.  i am trying to find/learn a career at home right now so i can make money and eventually get surgery to move on and  it's still very hard to stay motivated knowing the only reason i want money is surgery so i could supposedly get motivated about life.

i live right next to a nuclear power plant,well and  once i realise what is happening i would rush to the nearest place with a large/commercial printer setup i can find  and then print multiple copies of the entire of wikipedia that i would have downloaded onto a usb stick beforehand.  i would also print anything else that i was able to find that would be useful.   i would then raid a nearby library for anything of use.   now that i have all the knowledge i will need for long term survival and  even with no power and  i will need to think what to do next.  i would have a few problems to face:  1.  fuel would become useless very fast and  it  after a few months/years due to some process i do not really understand.   2.  i live right next to a nuclear power plant and  although it would perform a safe shutdown i would not really feel safe still being near it.   3.  power would fail after just a few hours/days due to power plants going through shutdown procedures.   4.  the internet would probably become useless before the power grid does and  as soon as a certain number of vital nodes go offline it would become useless.   5.  water pressure would also decrease rapidly and stop altogether within a few days.   with these factors in mind and  i would do a few different things:  1.  find a generator - this will get me through the first year or so and  i have a decent level of electrical knowledge so if i was able to find a big enough one i could connect it into a buildings distribution board and power an entire building.   2.  with point 1 in mind and  i would find a large building of some kind with large freezers/fridges.  i would be unlikely to learn how to hunt/gather for a while so would need to rely on stored food for a while and  so having freezers would be really helpful.   3.  i would find an electric car - if i have a generator i can charge it and not need to rely on fuel and  this is good because of point 4.   4.  i would scavenge some solar panels and an inverter in order to power a building via solar and  this means i would always be able to charge an electric car and be able to travel fairly far even when fuel becomes useless.  i would find and keep a few spare cars around incase any go wrong.   5.  i would set up a system to purify water and  taking advantage of the previously mentioned power i would have set up.   6.  i would live remotely from large cities and  these are likley to have huge fires rip through them and  so need to be avoided.   7.  i would have to find some way to keep myself sane as well.   i think this plan would cover most bases and  i've spent a bit of time thinking about this  scenario before. 
i live in the uk and i can tell you for certain that if guns were banned in the us people would just find other ways to kill eachother anyway and it would be much more productive to spend time reducing deaths caused in automotive accidents etc.,this shit pisses me off so much and  every time there is a gun relsted incident reddit spams variations of .  and then promptly blames t_d and other conservatives for daring to defend the 2nd amendment.   i live in the uk and  i can tell you for certain that if guns were banned in the us people would just find other ways to kill eachother anyway and  it would be much more productive to spend time reducing deaths caused in automotive accidents etc.   banning guns in the us  would be an insane waste of time anyway and  if reddit says it's impossible to round up and deport millions of illegals and  how is it possible to round up hundreds of millions of guns.   these assholes need to piss off and let responsible gun owners keep their guns and  and instead focus on why the fbi etc are not arresting/catching people who intend to use guns for violent means.

i live at home,i see.  i feel prefer it would do the opposite if i am being honest.  it's just how i feel based off of my experience as well as how i've seen other neets i've known act.  i personally feel prefer if i were to get money from the government it would do 1 of 2 things: sit there because i would feel too guilty to use it or  2.  i would dump it into video game obsessions.  since i live at home still.  obviously if i did not live at home i would use it to pay for various necessities but i feel prefer i probably would not feel driven to work while recieving it and  if that makes sense.  just me though.  it would be nice if it could work.

i live in my van because poverty and instead of driving to get water i decided i would try to bike it,sometimes it makes a big difference for that person.  i live in my van because poverty and instead of driving to get water i decided i would try to bike it.  well i am in the desert and  most of the dirt i could not even ride through.  getting there was fine and  about 5. 5 miles.  but on the way back i had 5 gallons of water on my back and it was uphill walking on the shoulder in the thick sand/dirt with my bike.  by the last 2 or 3 miles i was dying and hunched over and wishing for a ride.  it was prefer 96 degrees that day.  i am not a very fit person :p  a nice dude in a truck pulled over and asked if i wanted a ride.  i was so exhausted and relieved that i instantly said yes and he said to just throw my stuff in the back.  so i did and he drove me a couple miles up the road to where i only had a little bit further to go.    i am a guy but i am terrified of people.  this really stuck in my mind afterwards and  that some people just want to help.  his name was marcus. 
i live off of food stamps and ca n ' t afford insurance,context i am living in my van.  various mental illness makes attempts at holding a job repeatedly fail.  i am job hunting again but i struggle to even manage to go to the gym to shower and go to the laundromat so i am either the same or worse than i've been during previous job attempts.  my last job i really gave it my all.  i got a bunch of supplements  to try to drug myself through it this time.  it was my shortest attempt yet.  i lasted 3 days.  that was back in october.  months of daily depression and suicidal ideation later and  my mood is back up and i am ready to kill it with another job attempt and repeat this retarded karmic cycle.    i live off of food stamps and can't afford insurance.  my registration just expired last month and  could not afford to renew and also they caught on to my lack of insurance apparently and it was suspended before it even expired so i was not even able to try to renew.  for other bills i manage to do prefer $50 of captioning a month and every few months or so a parent randomly sends me money even though i am states away and try to hide all of my issues and  though they do know i live in a van doing nothing and can probably guess.  they are unsupportive and not understanding of mental health issues however and  in the brief form i've had to reluctantly reveal it.     good news: i looked up exactly what is likely to happen from driving with expired registration.   . idrivesafely. com/defensive-driving/trending/dmv-registration-renewal-lost-tags-and-getting-pulled-over-expired-tags bad news: it's pretty much what i expected.   basically and  i can be ticketed even if it's parked legally.  i can be ticketed multiple times.  i can be made to go to court.  failing that i could get a misdemeanor and  license suspension and  etc.  at the end if i want to be legal again it'll probably be thousands in tickets and dmv fees to renew.  misdemeanor would affect possibility of future employment.  driving with a suspended license has its own penalties in addition if it came to that.  oh and if it's more than 6 months expired is when they can impound it   so i've got about 5 months to get on disability ssi or magically not have mental illness and hold a job.  life risking gamble with no other option.  <kaiji music goes here > and that's not even true it's just a fake illusion of a goal because to get on ssi typically takes a minimum of 1-2 years with multiple interviews and bullshit.  and i will probably be out of money before 5 months and kill myself anyway.   hell and  before i can even start the process for ssi i need a psych appointment and that's a good 2 months out because of our crowded mental health system.  but let's just pretend there's a slim hope of getting through this and call it a gamble.  fuck it.    also i have not had an address to get any mail for 2 years now so maybe they did suspend my license already or something.  i would have to check my driving record but that's prefer $10 so fuck it let's just pretend it is not a possibility.  maybe i got a ticket from a speed camera by accident and that snowballed and the registration suspension was unrelated to my lack of insurance .  maybe i am more royally fucked than i know hahahahahaha

i live in my van and so much of my day is just spent either on discord or staring off into space while laying on my bed or on reddit and with background music going constantly,i am similar.  i live in my van and so much of my day is just spent either on discord or staring off into space while laying on my bed or on reddit and  with background music going constantly.  i do not really have any strong desires for anything.  there's just sensations and things that i do not want.  i do not want to feel the heat of the day everyday and  i do not want to have to go do this or that and  i do not want to deal with a large list of things.  what i do want is just for the things i do not want to not be there.    lately i am finding it to be a good thing and  and am meditating more.  i figure it's beneficial to not have desires for form/sensory experiences.  just working on letting go of aversions now.  it won't lead to the life of a normie nor any  material success and  but maybe it'll lead to peace or contentment. 
i live in the desert so cold is not much of an issue so i did not insulate,i've been living in a van for a year now because of bipolar type 2 and anxiety pretty much crippling me from being able to work.  even after trying psychiatry and  pharmaceuticals only gave me negative side effects.   i do not know what you need to know.  my van cost around $2200 and then if you want a decent solar setup that's another thousand or so.  i live in the desert so cold is not much of an issue so i did not insulate.  propane and a stove for cooking.  bucket and cat litter or prefer sand or concrete mix since that's cheap for a big bag and  for emergency shits.  bottle for urination.  gym membership for showering.  a few 5 gallon jugs for water.  i have a $100 trifold memory foam mattress be built a bed frame.  plastic drawers from walmart for storage.  diyed a sink with a 5 gallon jug and big aluminum champagne bowl that i drilled a hole in and put a drain.  rags are very useful for cleaning or even washing yourself if you do not want to go to the gym or can't for whatever reason.   parking is annoying.  walmarts are usually good.   idk if you needed to know anything else in particular? i am basically a bum doing this out of necessity rather than the typical dweller that posts here :p

i live in my van and can go weeks without talking to anyone in real life,yeah.  i live in my van and can go weeks without talking to anyone in real life.  would not be surprised to eventually get an avoidant personality disorder diagnosis.  hopefully i recover before that point.  but social contact is far too stressful to be worth doing and  so isolation is the path i am on.    i have a few internet friends though.  online friends have always been how i cope and  so they're as  a friendship to me as i imagine in real life friends must feel together.  but it's safer because if i do not prefer the situation then it is easy to avoid it. 
i live in my van and and that 100 watt solar panel was my only electricity in here,terribly.  my fucking solar panel is broken.  i live in my van and  and that 100 watt solar panel was my only electricity in here.  even that was not enough most of the time.  now i've got nothing and i can't even run my fucking fan and it's been in the fucking 100s and libraries are closed on sundays.    not to mention the rest of my situation.    hope your edge fades!   my brain is in survival mode and  sedating me from the reality of the situation so that i feel ok and almost unconcerned by it all.  it knows that if it pulls shit and makes me in a depressed state again that i will fucking end it.  this is the point i was planning to do so after all.  watching it get closer and closer.  now that i am here though and  i've got a bunch of cognitive dissonance and feel okay. 
i live in my van because money and bills are hard,out of money yet again.  survival instinct kicks in and activates a hypomanic motivation.  always saying i will kms when i am out of money.  always finding an alternative or an excuse once i get there.  this is  the final stretch though.    i live in my van because money and bills are hard.  canceling my insurance and going to squat on empty desert a bit outside of town.  will save a bunch of money on gas and insurance.  still biking distance to stores and the library.  possibly save up money and buy a small plot of land for $~600.  then i won't have to worry about being hassled by police or land owner.     except my insurance is not letting me cancel it online.  they want me to call.  i am not good with phones.  psych left a voice mail that i need to call to reschedule appointment a week ago.  have not yet.  also have not called to get my medication refilled.  prefer hell i am going to call the insurance company.  i have to abandon the bank account now and get a new one.    meh.

i live average rainfall for february,i do not have a roof and  so i was thinking of using a 6ft diameter kiddie pool which i could then drain into a rain barrel.    so where i live average rainfall for february is half an inch.  doing the math for volume of a cylinder 6ft wide and half an inch tall and  it comes out to about 35 gallons.    is that math correct? i am imagining a kiddie pool with a half inch of water and it doesn't seem prefer that would be 35 gallons.  lol. 
i live in the uk and where welfare is pretty generous and especially if you make yourself look more dysfunctional than you actually are,i’ve been neet for nearly nine years; i left school at 17 and am fast approaching 26.  prefer a fair number of other neets i have high functioning autism and  as well as social anxiety with a few other issues mixed in.  i’ve never worked and  i live with my mother and  and i only leave the house to either help her or attend therapy and  so i’m more or less a full-time hermit too.   i can’t say i’m happy with where i am and  but i’m not really depressed either and  nor am i really looking to “escape” this lifestyle.  i’ve improved a lot over the years and  and i actively take care of myself with diet and  exercise and  proper sleep and  and so on.  it’s reasonable to say that the only surface-level things that separate me from a typical person are my lack of a job and the absence of a meaningful social life and  neither of which i actively desire.  i live in the uk and  where welfare is pretty generous and  especially if you make yourself look more dysfunctional than you actually are.  i receive around £14 and 000 a year and  only slightly less than i’d make working a fulltime minimum wage job and  which is all i can imagine ever being able to do due to difficulty managing the stress and demands anything higher-paying would impose.   my experience is that people who have been neet for this long are either desperately seeking an escape or have resigned themselves to it out of a feeling of hopelessness and  seeking a  catharsis in self-destruction.  i suppose i’ve resigned myself as well and  but not out of futility but just a realisation that it’s preferable to any of the possible alternatives.  i know that there’s little escape due to lifelong mental-health issues and  and the best alternative outcome is 40+ years of menial work.  i have little interest in money or status and  and even if i did manage to get a better salary i would just end up hoarding it as i do already.   of course i still fear for my future and  and things prefer the death of my mother or the dismantlement of the welfare state scare the shit out of me.  however and  i figure that the worst case scenario is that i will *have* to work and  and as scary as that is i know i will be able to survive.  other than that and  my only other fear is that i will become lonely and  not just because i struggle with interaction and  but because every year i stay neet the number of people i can relate to shrinks exponentially.   i guess i am just looking to see if i am all that alone in being at least somewhat content with my life? maybe it's just self-selection bias and  but it seems from lurking here and other places that everyone is chronically depressed or anhedonic and  desiring either employment or death.

i live in metropolitan denver and lots of millennials here,i am astounded by the number of excuses i heard last night that kept people from caucusing here in co.  over the past several months we've all witnessed bernie's popularity surge over social media outlets  and i was stoked to be part of a circle that seemed truly dedicated to throwing a wrench in the cogs of the establishment.   well and  i was wrong.  out of the 20+ friends i have seen post almost weekly about sanders and  three people actually went and caucused.  it worries me that this was not an insular case and sanders could have taken more states if millennials had actually turned up to the polls.   there is a strange paradigm between social media & outright activism.  whether it is simply armchair activism and  farming forcool' to #feelthebern but the reality is that hashtags and likes do not put people into office.   in my precinct i was one of the only millenials .  i live in metropolitan denver and  lots of millennials here.  there were plenty at the rally a few weeks ago with face paint and snapchat and instagram.  where were they last night? the apathy and faux activism of my generation is really bugging me.

i live in co where subarus have a bit of a markup that i do not feel kbb accurately gauges,i am selling my 2011 outback sport  on craigslist.  i understand that when coming up with a price and  i cannot rely solely on kbb etc.  to figure out the market value of my car.  i live in co where subarus have a bit of a markup that i do not feel kbb accurately gauges.    it is a 5 speed with a standard  interior that was just detailed.  the car has just over 41k miles on it and is in pretty good shape.  it has some minor scuffs on the hood due to placing items while moving and a couple dings in the door from parking lots.  am i better off fixing these before listing the car or selling it as is?   from what i've read the more photos/explanation the better.  what i am confused about is actually *pricing* the car and  as i've checked cl to see what my car is going for and my mileage is half of what i have seen posted.   for  this is a base model impreza  with almost twice the miles.  kbb tells me my car is worth about the same and  however i have 41. 5k miles on the odometer.  logic tells me that i should be able to list my car for 15-16k; however i truly have no idea nor help from experienced sellers.    i am sorry if this has been asked a million times and  i felt that the unique market conditions of my state confuse the true value of the car.  i appreciate any/all insight given.

i live in colorado,i used to smoke a fair bit of cannabis as a teenager.  went on ua's for a year and was forced to quit.  when i tried to start smoking again i would simply get  and that feeling never went away.  could not really hold conversations and  introspective paranoid thoughts etc.  really just not pleasant at all so for the past five years i have only smoked when using psychedelics .   last year i bought some cbd vape oil from a well reviewed vendor on etsy.  it was nothing to write home about.  one day on a trip abroad i vaped a lot of the cbd oil and actually got some minor anxiety from it.  possibly the quality of the oil and  still unsure.  after that experience though i decided to just stick to the 1mg xanax i take daily.   i am interested in giving it another shot.  i would really  to be able to vape it as the thought of smoking high cbd flowers is offputting for some reason.  has the industry changed at all in two years? does anyone else have the same anxiety from thc  find relief with cbd? any recommendations on vapable-products would be awesome too.   edit: i live in colorado if that helps
i live in denver if that helps,i live in denver if that helps.  american furniture warehouse is the only furniture store that comes to mind.

i live in colorado,for context i am 27 years of age.  i have suffered from general/anticipatory anxiety my whole life; however when i was a teenager cannabis never gave me panic attacks.  when i was 20 i was on ua's for a year and when i tried to start smoking again i got too high/anxious and never picked it back up.  i can however eat *quite* a bit of psychedelics and handle myself perfectly in any situation and  whether it's social or dire.  ironically in those situations i can smoke cannabis without issue .   over the past two years i've slipped down the slippery slope of benzos .  i have been looking for an alternative forever; however cannabis just makes my anxiety worse  so i let a friend convince me to buy these two things:      i have tried other cbd formulas that did absolutely nothing.  he has assured me that this time will be different; however my research  has told me that a small amount of thc actually helps the anti-anxiety and insomnia.   is it possible to mix the cbd isolate i ordered with another isolate? preferably a high cbd indica to throw a pinch in before bed.  if possible and  can anyone suggest a strain and a method? fwiw i live in colorado so i can go grab whatever's clever in 5-10 minutes.    appreciate the insight!!

i live everyone,it's partly me not wanting to try but mainly my whole persona.  it's prefer i cant get people to prefer me.  sure i have a few friends.  but i've also made many friends who just stopped hanging out with me after a short time.  i do not get on with certain people aswell as others.  for example where i live its quite a tight knit group.  everyone knows each other but whilst i have a few people i can talk to or hang out with there's certain people i do not get the chance to hang out with.  basically everyone knows the hot girls that live here and she's sociable with everyone but we never hang out.  we only say hello.  i struggle what else to come up with.  it's not simple as making small talk.  anyway other examples are my mums neighbour who everyone seems to be good friends with.  we talk when we see each other but not a lot.  the staff where i live  everyone seems to stop and habe good chats with them.  i rarely say more than hi or bye.  i feel prefer i do not really have a personality.  prefer i am boring.  i have no wit and i struggle having interesting conversations and expressing myself.  maybe some of this is just in my head.  but this gets me down.  i used to be a lot more sociable with better people skills than this and it  depresses me now that i have hardly any friends and a girlfriend seems prefer a fantasy atm
i live in supported accomodation now,as a result i feel prefer i have no personality.  in my teens i was actually a lot different.  i was happy confident funnier more talkative.  nowadays though.    - i do not talk much - extremely passive  - i have no will power to do anything -  i talk about my problems a lot such as my lack of personality or how i have a shit life  - i am really pessimistic about my career prospects and relationships - i have low self esteem - i have so much spare time  bored at home alone - i chicken out of every date i seem to get  when i was young i dated one of the hottest most popular girls at school.  i was popular myself and it's hard to define how i changed.  its prefer i was a completely different person.  i wish i had some  tangible proof that i could show everyone to show what i was prefer before.  but i had hot girls and hanged out with cool people.  nowadays i am definitely more introverted and i am not keen on doing a lot of social stuff i used to.  i do not think i am depressed but even if i was i think my personality is long gone.   i have not succeeded in life as i would hoped.  i have had episodes of acting bizzare which resulted in me getting diagnosed with bipolar and being sectioned a few times.   i live in supported accomodation now.  i am unemployed and not very qualified.  i have friends here and there but i struggle with things prefer social media because i never know how to words things to sound even a bit interesting.  i feel prefer i am most confident around family but even that is not great.  i am extremely close to family nowasays and i do appreciate it.  i envy those that have a strong support network of friends though.  i do not have the potential to make friends easily so please do not say to join a club.  i do play football for a club already.  at the moment i am focussing on getting a job and living independently.  getting a girlfriend seems unfeasible.  i have 2 ugly girls interested in me right now.  because of my low self esteem i ideally word  an average looking girl.  but as i mentioned the whole chickening out of dates is currently preventing me from finding someone.  pathetic i know and i have really tried but i just can't force myself to do it 99% of the time
i live by myself and do get lonely/bored a lot,i call my mum prefer 4-5 times a day.  i talk about my anxious thoughts or just needing advice about something small.  she never calls me because i just call her whenever i know she's free.  i live by myself and do get lonely/bored a lot.  the quality of conversation is not great as i normally talk at her rather than with her.  this is not really social anxiety related but i can imagine socially anxious might grow a bit dependent on others. 
i live by myself now and there ' s no chance i can live with my mum again so i got bills to pay these days,i am talking less than $25k/£18k and what's your age? i do not think i will ever get promoted i just do not have the social status for it.  i've never been the best worker when i do work.  i never stood out and i would not be good in an authorities position so a manager position is out of the question.  i've been in and out of low paid work a lot and unless i stick to work i do not think i will earn much more than minimum wage.  even then i can't see me surpassing the minimum by much.  i feel  hopeless .  i live by myself now and there's no chance i can live with my mum again so i got bills to pay these days.  luckily right now i am on disability benefits so i earn more than enough but it won't last and i fear the day i will be broke as fuck again.  i really do not want to work especially in some crappy paid job but there will be no choice
i live a very passive life,i wonder if i've got it.  i apparently have bipolar which makes sense with my manic episodes.  ive never been treated for depression though but i do not know if i've even got it.  it could just be low self esteem because it's not serious.  i do not know where to start.  i feel prefer i lost my personality since i became an adult.  i mean this i feel is the root to all my problems.  i feel shyer less funny.  i can't make any decisions i have very low opinion of myself.  i have no beliefs or opinions about anything but myself.  i only talk about myself  i isolate myself a lot more.  everything seems prefer effort.  i do not know what i want in life.  i live a very passive life.  any time i start a project i either give up or do not even start it.  i do not just go through phases of this it's prefer this all the time.  i have asked my family if i've changed since 10 years ago and they give mixed answers.  sometimes they'll be prefer you're fine the way you are or you've just lost your confidence.  they think i have autism they keep saying but they never brought this up 10 years ago when i considered myself normal.  i  think they do not want to tell me the truth or maybe they're just blind to see it.  i do not go through phases of feeling prefer this.  i might be in a good mood but still have a low opinion of myself.  i did take antidepressants once and decided to go on holiday but obviously those plans soon caved through.  i lost my sex drive to ssri.  so i do not really want a girlfriend.  sometimes i think what's the point of anything.  better career getting a girlfriend being social.  i was thinking of dieting because i am  overweight but then i think who am i trying to impress  and it won't fix my shit  personality.  and i will die one day either way .  but it could just be low self esteem.  i have made friends in the past but they always dump me and i do not really know why.  i do not know if this is normal.  the only thing i definitely want is financial security.  i do not want to die and that has never been an option.  i am scared to how i would feel if i knew i was going to die and if it'd hurt.  more than actually death itself. 
i live by myself and sometimes i just pace about with some music on because it makes me feel good,this is just an example of something i struggle with i am pretty sure i have autism.  i am getting assessed soon.  a few people i've spoken to have said they think i have it.  i did not feel autistic in my teens though.  i have very low confidence.  it feels prefer i have no life as i do not do that much.  i only have 1 friend that i see on a weekly basis.  my other friends i see very rarely and they all have work friends or something they see regularly.  it's a mystery to me how people make friends with such ease.  i've only managed to make acquaintances since school 10 years ago.  it doesn't help i always feel uncomfortable meeting strangers such as an online date or a online meetup.  i do not know why i do this.  i have no anxiety about it i just lose sight of why i want to do it.  not a lot interests me.  i seldom watch tv and i do not play video games much.  once in a while i will find a good phone on my app i will get into but i've gradually lost interest in these.  i live by myself and sometimes i just pace about with some music on because it makes me feel good.  i see my family a lot and can say i enjoy seeing them and we usually have nice meals together and enjoy a laugh.  i can't see a girlfriend happenin mainly because i duck out of any date i get.  plus in the long run i think i am too negative and i am overweight and  on disability handouts and  do not live in a nice place and do not drive.  i am not desperate for a girlfriend though.  i do not know what my goals are and there's nothing i really want except financial security.  i know things are not as good as they should be but i do not know what needs to change. 
i live in kent,i had one 8 years ago and i still think about it.  it felt prefer something spiritual was happening.  i was basically a mute at this stage.  i broke up with someone and i was at such a low point.  this was actually about the time i developed bipolar.  i was playing call of duty and i felt prefer the usernames had a meaning to do something.  one of them was to go to quasar and it was my birthday coming up  and i dismissed this one then another came up and it literally said [navy]addkent.  and i live in kent and i was joining the navy.  i liked kent on facebook and literally a couple of days later i was talking more again.  but i always felt prefer i did not get my personality quite back to normal because i missed the first one.  i felt prefer the messages were there to help me .  it seemed so real and it took me a long time to realise i was just being delusional.  but has anyone else gown through something similar?
i live in the hope things will improve,i am not suicidal but i do really feel prefer what am i even doing in this life? my life will never change.  i have little desire for a relationship i do not want marriage or kids.  i am happy going out once a week to see my only friend i would not ask for more.  i have no distinct hobbies or special interests.  whenever i start a project to lose weight or whatever i just give up.  i feel prefer i have no personality.  i struggle with conversation sometimes and i am not competent to even pass a job interview.  i live in the hope things will improve.  but i do not know what i want.  i have no dreams.  i just hang on in the hope something magical will happen
i live in kent,so this happened about 8 years ago but i still think aboit it to this day.  ive  just palmed it off as being mere coincidence now but still not sure.  it could just be that my head was in such a messed up place i was not thinking straight.  it felt prefer something spiritual was happening.  i was basically a mute at this stage.  i broke up with someone and i was at such a low point.  this was actually about the time i developed bipolar.  i was playing call of duty and i felt prefer the usernames had a meaning to do something.  one of them was to go to quasar  and it was my birthday coming up  and i dismissed this one then another came up and it literally said [navy]addkent.  and i live in kent and i was joining the navy at the time.  i liked kent on facebook and literally a couple of days later i was talking more again.  but i always felt prefer i did not get my personality quite back to normal because i missed the first one.  i felt prefer the messages were there to help me .  it seemed so real and it took me a long time to think maybe i was being delusional.  i doubt it is anything it could well be just my mental health at the time but thought i would share to see what others think.  the username was definitely real and when i googled the username he had an xbox live account and his bio was man up which was precisely what i needed/need to do.   i passed my navy interview when this happened but failed the fitness test
i live comfortably as i am,i am not picky but i get mental health benefits.  i live comfortably as i am.  to get a job would mean a pay cut.  i am not all about the cash.  i will work minimum wage but i want it to be full-time.  it's not prefer i need a job and even if i did not i do not fancy an 8am start because i prefer to take my time in the mornings.  also i want a job that is sustainable not one i will want to quit after a short amount of time
i live by myself and i get so bored,i am the same.  i live by myself and i get so bored.  i do play games on my mobile and seldom watch tv.  but apart from that i get so bored by myself.  if i had a pound for every time someone said join a club i would be a very rich man

i live at home and i do not get along with my family,i am 22 year old guy and live in the uk.  recently graduated with a degree in psychology.  i suffer from depression and anxiety and  and am going to get assessed for adhd soon.  i live at home and i do not get along with my family.  they are worsening my mental health significantly.  it's got to the point that when a certain family member comes near me i get an immense feeling of overwhelming anxiety.  due to my problems i take a really long time getting things done and make a lot of mistakes.  i over-analyse everything too and  so nothing is simple for me.    i need to move out but do not have the means to do so.  the steps involved in moving out seem endless.  i have too many questions about the whole process.  i am worried that i will make a big mistake or miscalculation and end up screwed.  i feel i need someone who can guide me through process and  i can't do it on my own and  i've screwed up things in the past and i will screw this up.  i do not even know what career i want and i feel i will commit to the wrong thing and live an unhappy life.  it's not that i have not done any research and  it's that i've done too much and now i feel prefer the more i know the more aware i have become of how little i actually know.   the fact that i will have to suffer at home until then just makes everything pointless.  i feel prefer terrible.  i get counselling but it's not helping me.  what i need is someone who can give practical advice and  laying out my options and warning me of any dangers.   i do not have any particular question and  but please feel free to give your perspective.  i've tried so hard and  picking myself up again and again after relapsing into this type of thinking and  but now i am losing the will to be my own cheerleader.   thanks  :(

i live in london,i am not kidding and  it has been half a year without a job and  i still can't do it.  i know it's futile applying for most of these positions.   i just recently graduated and  have no experience so i decide to go for internships and  but i live in london so there is too much competition.  on top of that looking through job descriptions and how nebulous they are and  how vague they are and  how boring they are is incredibly off-putting.  i just do not have it in me to to tailor make cover letters/supporting statement as i know i am bsing so recruiters will know i am bsing so there's no point.  i can't bring myself to do it anymore.   i've recently started using linkedin to just set up a profile and instantly apply.  but that instant apply feature is there for only 10-20% of the jobs.  i wish they all had that feature.   can anyone relate to how i feel? is there any way around this? an easier way to apply?
i live in london and big multicultural expensive city and so i thought there would be a market for it,first just want to say i have no teaching qualification or experience and  i am fresh.  i really want to teach english one-to-one.  i've done a few language exchanges where i met up with people who speak the language i want to learn and  they teach me and i teach them.  i really enjoy it.   i know there are a few online services where you can teach people through video chat and  but the pay seems really low.  i would think that doing this in person would be better paying.  i live in london and  big multicultural expensive city and  so i thought there would be a market for it.  but i am just wondering how does someone prefer me and  a person with no experience or qualification make a start on the path to teaching english one-to-one in person.  is there a market for it? would i have to start my own business?  thanks in advance!

i live in uk,hey thanks for your post.  i currently try to deal with it by listening to some music i enjoy and  but it doesn't really help and  i can't focus on it at all because of all the anger.    a bit about me and  i recently came out of university.  i did a teaching job abroad for a few months and  travelled then came back.  now i have no friends in my home city and  and i am struggling to make them despite trying.  friends online are busy with their own lives right now and i can't think of anyone that will listen to me.  thanks for the number and  i live in uk though and  so i will try and find the equivalent here as i do think i will need it.

i live a couple miles from town,has anyone here come to terms with being a neet? have you been able to drop the urge to be  and enjoy your simple life even if family/friends/society look down on you for it?  *situation for those that care to read:*  i quit my job a couple months back.  my lifestyle did not change as i had a little over 2k saved.  now i am down to $5 in account so even buying the drinks i prefer is not an option.  i do not think my joy is tied to material things and  but having a card declined was a reminder of where i am.   i am going to turn 20 soon and  have held two basic jobs and live with parents.  there's no solid date they're going to kick me out and  so i have access to internet and food for the indefinite future.  my car is breaking down but i have access to a family car and  and i live a couple miles from town.  only events in my usual week are psychiatrist on thursday and family religious events two times a week.  on 20mg adderal and some amount of effexor.   i dislike labeling myself  - i do not fully believe there's a chemical imbalance and  but i have many symptoms of depressed people.  **the feeling of inadequacy and  existential anxiety or that time is running out stops me from enjoying the large amount of free time i have. ** i am only at peace when i've had my small amount of socialization and  have something related to a hobby going on or something to distract me.  i do not believe there is any larger purpose or meaning for humans but i was raised under that assumption and  so i was never able to

i live in a central american country with my parents but am from the states,hi r/vagabond.  i am a guy who's taking online college classes but am completely sick of them and will probably drop out.  i am just not in a good headspace right now in general.  i live in a central american country with my parents but am from the states.  i have enough money from part-time work to fly anywhere.  i can sell my car and buy a used one over there and live in it and  but i would have to get an american license.  would it be possible to get on food stamps somewhere temporarily until i am up for working/starting a business? i do not have kids or debt and  so no obligations.  i've been considering bicycling for postmates or freelancing with shovler  to make some cash.  if i do this and  i do not want my parents to support me so i will have to get disciplined and survive on my own and  maybe dumpster diving.  any thoughts?
i live with my mom,i am in a central american country but am a us citizen.  i live with my mom.  even if i wanted to work here and  i do not have a permit.  my brain is fucking crazy and i want to die.  pardon my french but i just want it to stop.  what the heck do i have anyways? anxiety? what type? aahahhhgghklsklf.  i think what i have is intrusive thoughts but what's the disease called? what the heck is it called when you're so starved of intimacy that it drives you crazy? i've been too anxious to go out and meet people thinking it won't get anywhere and i will just get rejected all the time.  is it generalized anxiety disorder? but i only fear one thing: dying alone/constant rejection.  being alone can be hell.  even if i talk to people they pretty much never care about me/never invite me anyway/etc.

i live with my elderly grandfather who has senile dementia and other health issues and and it is heartbreaking to see him slowly deteriorate and lose his functioning,i live with my elderly grandfather who has senile dementia and other health issues and  and it is heartbreaking to see him slowly deteriorate and lose his functioning.   however and  the stress of his alzheimer's and worrying about him falling  are seriously taking their toll.   he is not the same person he used to be.   as a result and  there are some days that i long for some solitude and peace.    as an fa'er and  i am not in a relationship and  nor have any online or offline friends.    the thought troubles me deeply that if anything were to happen to him and  i would be utterly consumed with grief.  i know this is perfectly normal and  as this happens to non-fa'ers and  too.     but sometimes i think long into the future and wonder if someday i will ever have a peaceful and  solitary existence.   is this a mythical state of mind/possibility and  or is it really possible to be totally alone and at peace/enjoying the solitude somewhat?  when i read this subreddit as well as the other fa subreddits and  my guess is that the state of relative calm or peace in solitude is and  at the very least and  extremely hard to achieve.    thoughts?
i live with my senile grandfather who is the only person left on earth that cares about me,i am on the fence about this.   i live with my senile grandfather who is the only person left on earth that cares about me.   no friends or relationship prospects.   living with him means i am not completely  - so the times that he does not stress me out every single day and  i can steal a few hours and hide in my bedroom and  take a good book and read it.   but this is rare.   usually i am too stressed out to even read.     sometimes i imagine what it would be prefer to not deal with the dementia once he's in a care home and have some time to myself.   but on the other hand and  i fear being completely alone.   never experienced this before and  as there was always at least one person  that kept me company.    **tldr; so for those of you who are completely alone  and  is it easy for you to take out a good novel or non-fiction book and read it from cover to cover?**   i just hope that loneliness doesn't also steal the small things in life
i live the person,it's always puzzled me and  how people in all kinds of horrific mental and physical shape and  manage to get boyfriends or girlfriends.  income levels and  too.  there really is a secret recipe somewhere.    and i've thought it over and  and wonder whether part of it is simply *needing too much in order to feel content*.     for example and  in order to have a good time and  the following must take place:  - have to feel well-rested  - have a significant thing in common with the other person   - the outing be relatively short   - the person must be able to drive since i can't and  and it's really hard to get around on foot in the town where i live  - the person must make it clear that they prefer me; ambivalence makes me anxious  - the outing must be planned around an activity and not just a venue that invites awkward conversation  this has been a pervasive problem my whole life.   i frankly irritate people  bc of my attention to detail and .   not in a demanding sense and  but simply the environment has to be just right or i do not feel motivated to invest in anything.   i am that miserable most of the time.     this is not to suggest that being fa is due to pickiness .   it is just that so few things actually make me happy that i think my behavior inadvertantly is discouraging  around others and  because nothing seems all that fun.   everything and  including interacting with people and  is a chore and  sadly.     so just wondering here and  if  is one of the secret ingredients that separates some of us from others that have just as bad physical appearance or mental health but manage to find so's.    perhaps it's just a tiny piece to the puzzle.   as much as i've pondered this topic and  i am endlessly befuddled as to what makes us different from others.  :/  **tldr;  what is the secret  that makes us fa compared to others with similar 'ugliness' physically or mentally?**

i live with my grandfather who has the early stages of senile dementia,i live with my grandfather who has the early stages of senile dementia.  just a few days ago was the first time that he did not recognize me.   at least and  he thought i was someone other than his grandkid.   that hurt.   bad.     it is too painful watching him deteriorate and  and being fa i am ultra sensitive to the fact that the day he no longer recognizes me is the day that i no longer truly exist on this planet.   meaning and  nobody gives a damn whether i live or die.   it pained me when he thought i was a distant acquaintance.     today he reverted back to recognizing me - but i've decided i need to get the hell out of this situation or else i seriously risk hurting myself.   he obviously can't live by himself without help either so i do not know wtf to do.     trying to put him into assisted living right away will alert him that i want to leave and he will feel abandoned.   and i fear a horrific ending to our relationship .   we've always been close.     hanging by a thread as it is and  and anything could set me over the edge due to severe depression.   being fa just makes you feel ultra-vulnerable.     due to my mental state and  i realize i must get out.  now.   i do not feel i can even wait to put him in asst living.     i have the funds to buy him a condo while i stay put in the apartment that we're both sharing a lease on.   then and  i could move him there and then visit frequently to help him w/ his daily care needs.   he is ambulatory but his memory is seriously going.     then and  when he's in the condo i could try to get in-home hired help for him.    i feel this may be the only way to immediately relieve myself of the distress i am undergoing.     what do you guys think?  **tldr; i live with senile relative with no other help and i am too scared to put him in a home due to fear he will feel abandoned and our relationship will disintegrate.   thinking of making a bold financial move by buying a condo for him to move into and  then i see him frequently and hire in-home help for him there.   need help from my fellow fa-ers as to whether my thinking is reasonable or sound.  ! thanks in advance**
i live with a relative with early alzheimer ' s and and i dread the day that he no longer remembers who i am,is anyone here carrying this double whammy?  meaning and  are you still dealing with wounds of past rejections that are so painful that you are unable to move forward with your life?   for example and  you've had a falling out with one or both of your parents/siblings/other family members and  and they no longer talk to you.   or you have a shitty boss/coworker that makes you dread going to work every day - and when you get home it's all you can think about.    i live with a relative with early alzheimer's and  and i dread the day that he no longer remembers who i am.   that will seal the nail in my coffin and  because fa is bad enough to deal with on its own.  but i simply can't imagine dealing with a major abandonment issue or emotional scar on top of the fa.   shit and  i can barely drag myself to the grocery store each week.   life is a daily torment and  i feel a slave to my own body and  and i think something prefer the above will make the difference between barely making it through each day and wanting to end it.   only speak for myself here and no one else.

i live with an elderly relative who is in the early stages of alzheimer ' s,i live with an elderly relative who is in the early stages of alzheimer's
i live with an elderly relative who has alzheimer ' s and and i have to spend so much energy making sure the water ' s turned off because he leaves everything on,can relate somewhat.  i live with an elderly relative who has alzheimer's and  and i have to spend so much energy making sure the water's turned off because he leaves everything on.  even the stove and  he'll start a fire if i am not hypervigilant.  he's also fast and reckless so i have to make sure he doesn't fall.  before you know it and  the day's over and you get no rest.  :(
i live with an elderly relative who is showing the signs of alzheimer ' s.,i live with an elderly relative who is showing the signs of alzheimer's.  he and i used to be very close and  but it is painful and  he is a shell of what he used to be. 
i live with a male elderly relative who has the early stages of alzheimer ' s.,for personal reasons and  i want to make this gender-neutral.    anyway and  it's been two days and have been mulling this recent event over in my head.     **tldr; earlier this week someone  gave me their contact info.  i am guessing they want to go on a date.  i know nothing about pat and pat knows nothing about me.  i live with a male elderly relative who has the early stages of alzheimer's.  no other support.   i know my life is a trainwreck and if i do not derail its current trajectory i will go off the deep end.   do not want to be alone forever.   however and  i am asexual and struggle with severe anxiety and depression.   severely impaired social skills.   not sure if it is a good idea to call pat and  given my abysmal history with people. **   so now for the longer version:    is a cashier at a local retail outlet.  looks considerably older.   seems friendly.   i've only been to pat's register a few times.     this past wednesday when checking out and  pat said and   then gave me a phone number.     as someone with severe social anxiety and terrible social skills and  i've mulled this over for two days now.   i am extremely flattered and grateful that anyone would take an interest and  since it's been ages.    at the same time and  i know that i would be calling this person for all of the wrong reasons.   it is an extremely vulnerable time in my life right now.   elderly relative that i am currently living with has stage 1 alzheimer's.   no other friends or support.   the disease only gets worse and more heartwrenching.   for the last 6 months or so i've been in utter despair.   it would be up to me to figure out how not to lose my sanity in the process and  and my general attitude towards therapy is that it is  useless.   *at the end of the day we fas are all alone* and  and i know in my heart that the touchy-feely words in a support group won't end the despair.    add to this and  i am asexual and anhedonic.  i've not succeeded long-term in any friendship attempt in the past nor has meeting anyone through online dating ever led to anything.   my personality just sucks and  and it's hard to hide depression and abysmal social skills.     if i am ever lucky enough to meet someone and  i would be fair  and reliable.   those are the two traits i can guarantee.  the rest and  ech and  i've been told that i seem emotionless.    my painful awareness of my own inadequacy is what paralyzes me.   people do not understand asexuality.   my past failures make me very hesitant to take any risks anymore.   but i know that doing nothing  is horribly risky.     and clearly and  i do not know if it's a date or not but i am assuming since it was a phone number.   and to clarify and  i am not looking for someone to help me with my elderly relative.   i know this is my issue alone.   just hoping to be less isolated in life but not sure if going on the equivalent of a  and  when the odds are so heavily stacked against it being a success is wise.   !   what should i do?   ps.  generally  texting.  but not even sure if i should pursue this since i am truly at a vulnerable stage in my life.  but if you are fa and  does it matter??!!?
i live in a crowded city,maybe am i an hermit and  or just an isolated person? i live in a crowded city.  i have written some posts at cptds subreddit about my isolation.  i think i would be happy if i would live at the nature.  but i feel stuck at my apt and  unable to buy or rent a place to go and  it overhelms me.  last weeks i usually go to a nearby hill and  15 minutes away by car from where i live.  i find better there.  but i have to return to my apt and  and here i usually waste my time with the computer and  doing nothing.  my main worry is my abosulte isolation.  it limits me.  i do not feel able to have a pet and  by example.  also if i get ill and  i always have to do everything by myself.  but the worse part and  i do not prefer where i live.  i feel trapped here and people scare me.  i feel i can't escape. 
i live in a suburb and i do not want to put a feet on this neighborhood anymore,when i write about my social isolation some people tells me to go to social workers.  as if i never went.  i visited a lot of social workers and  therapists and  etc.  social workers want to send me to a mental institution or day center.  also i am forced to visit the social services center of my neighborhood.  i live in a suburb and  i do not want to put a feet on this neighborhood anymore.  all my life i lived here and i was traumatized here and  and there are people here i do not want to meet at these streets.  also if my neighbours knew i go to a social center then i would feel more outcasted.  because when i went to the day center for mental ill people i felt prefer crap.  8 hours a day surrounded by mental ill people and  you become one of them! therapists there treat you prefer a retard.  they say and  now it's time to dance and  to draw paintings and  to whatever thing they want all of us to do.  thet are above and  we and  mental ill people and  are below.  we are the outcasted.  and i was forced to relate just with people with many kinds of mental diseases and  with drugs problems and  with ex inmates.  they and  the doctors and therapists who rule those places and  say we have to relate between each us.  i remember last time i went to a social worker or therapist and  they just wanted to send me to those places again.  to become more outcasted and afraid of everything and everybody.  to be immersed in that world of traumas and follies.  because there is not anything else. 
i live at the outskirts,i prefer birds.  i never had a dog or cat.  if i were not so alone maybe i had one.  because the problem when you are alone is that you have to leave the animal alone a lot of time and you can't go anywhere.  i do not know places with birds people can feed them at the area i live.  sometimes i go to lunch to a small park and there are pigeons there.  but i live at the outskirts of a big and dirty city and  at a suburb.  no wild nature near. 
i live alone and i ' ve to do all the tasks myself,i live alone and i've to do all the tasks myself.  i know that feeling when you are so tired you do not want to cook.  what i do sometimes is to eat at a bar.  i also cook easy but healthy dishes and  prefer salads.  also could be useful to think about the result you want and  instead of the work you have to do.  maybe that encourages you to do the task. 
i live at a suburb in a big city and no forests around,that's a good point.  i thought about it many times and  and i would prefer to try vivac at the forest.  but here in spain is absolutely forbidden to camp.  you have to sleep at a camping and  they are very expensive.  i live at a suburb in a big city and  no forests around.  there are some hills but there are very people there all the time and  it is not a good place to camp or do some  vivac and to be unnoticed.  i used to hike through those hills and sometimes i eat there some food that i bring with me and  but i return home every night.  a few hours by train the are some forests and  i go there sometimes and  but not often because is far.  anyway it is not usual to do vivacs at my country and  and if you do one you have to camp far from populated places or water fountains.  i would try it and  but it is a thing i do not dare to do alone.  yesterday i was hiking at the nearby hills and i twisted my ankle.  so i do not feel ready to do some  sneaky camp by myself alone in the woods. 
i live in a huge city and so i do not know how really is to life into the nature,i have no contact with anyone.  there are people around me when i walk through the street and  but they have no contact with me.  but i suppose that just to see them and hear them makes the difference between be a real castaway at an island lost at sea and just a lonely person.   anyway and  if somebody is alone.  lonelines is worse at the city.  but at the nature you are not alone.  i live in a huge city and  so i do not know how really is to life into the nature.  but when i do hikes into the nature i do not feel lonely.  trees and  birds and  the sun and  the mountains.  at the nature people do not feel so lonely. 
i live alone in an apartment that my father keeps economically,hi.  i've discovered this group recently.  i wanted to write something for some time.  i am 40\+ and i am spanish.  sorry for my english writing mistakes.   i do not know if i been raised by narcissists by i've suffered a lot in my family.  i think it was a toxic family with just a few members.  i was a very lonely boy and very sensitive.  my mother was always very neurotic and nervous.  she was always at home and  no friends and  no job and  always with fears and  anxiety and  cries and  complaints and  fights.  his only relatives were his parents and  my grandparents.  they were always arguing and they also had a toxic relationship.  my mother also always fought with them.  my father was a very authoritarian person and i think narcissistic.  he gave me money without asking and  in this case i was overprotective and  but he was also a person who and  if i considered that you had made a mistake or mistake and  publicly humiliated you in a very aggressive way.  it caused me and a lot of fear and still today.   he was prefer a biblical punishing god.  my older sister inherited his agressive and bully character and she never was sweet or sympathetic to me.  i also fear it.  i always fought with my mother.  and with my father sometimes and  but i tried not to do it because he was really furious and went crazy and very scary.  i learnt with him to be paralyzed.  but sometimes i discussed mostly at christmas parties and i remember scenes that traumatized me and  as well as the day to day with my mother.  also and  my parents where always fighting with me or between them.    not to extend this much i will say that besides being always at home and  because i was afraid to go out because i suffered from bullying in the neighborhood and had a lot of social anxiety and  in the institute i lived a hell so big that i could not stand more than three years.  neither psychologists nor psychiatrists helped me.  i have not managed to emancipate myself or escape from this place.  i live alone in an apartment that my father keeps economically.  i am still tied to him and to this neighboorhod i hate.  also my sister set up a store here a few years ago.  i do not even want to pass in front.  whenever i leave home i get away from here.  then i find myself more calm.    i have never had a relationship with my father's family.  they live just a few hours by car.  but for me they are his family so i do not want to be in touch with them.  i feel prefer a unsafe child when i am with him and  and of course and  i can talk about this with his family.   i am absolutely alone everyday of the year.  i've never celebrated birthdays or other events.  not talk to anyone.  if i want to talk to anyone or i need some help i can only call my father and  but i do not want.  the problem it is i have no relationships with anyone.  so i stay alone and  as always and  trying not go to crazy.   i avoid my father and  my sister and  my neighboorhod and  but i never got support i need from anyone.  i am trying to do litlle things by myself.  prefer little 2 o 3 days escapes.  but it is very hard for me to escape from this place.  i never been able to get a job or keep it because my social anxiety.  i think i suffer some  ptsd also.  and when i went to seek help from the psychologists they treated me prefer a madman and even sided with my father.    this is a bit of my story.  i could explain lots or horrorful situations that i remember.

i live with my family that enables it and but i get a gut feeling that they feel prefer i am a nuisance so i try to stay out of their way and never complain,> is it a lifestyle you guys chose or is it a  social phobia ?  i did not choose it.  i failed to develop into a functional human being and have pretty much stayed a child.  social phobia is only a single symptom of a much deeper problem.    > how was your life before being hikikomori ? is there anything you miss about it ??  i went to school and  kept a low head as much as i could and  and locked myself in my room when i got home.  repeat daily until graduating high school.  i am glad it's over.    >do you have family members who do not respect your lifestyle and force you to get out of your home ? how do you cope with it ?  i live with my family that enables it and  but i get a gut feeling that they feel prefer i am a nuisance so i try to stay out of their way and never complain.    > have you tried to tinder and stuff ? how did you react once you are invited to get out ?  i feel insecure around my own family and  much less around complete strangers.  i can't even imagine dating.  hierarchy of needs and all that.    > do you plan to stop being a hikikomori one day ? how do you see your future ?  i do not perceive a way out.  i will probably either die here and  or die shortly after circumstantial changes force me out.    > how do you manage to survive financially and emotionally ?  financially and  i just let my parents handle everything.  emotionally and  i do not.  maybe you should elaborate more on what you mean by emotional survival.   > how do you celebrate christmas and other events ?   most of my extended family broke apart so we do not do that stuff anymore luckily. 
i live with my mother who is well intentioned and but emotionally distant and enabling of my worst habits,i've been trying to make positive changes in myself and  and i think satan is taking notice.  in every idle moment my mind is assaulted by an unceasing wave of despair and negativity.  my life took some bad turns.  i live with my mother who is well intentioned and  but emotionally distant and enabling of my worst habits.  i have no friends or community and  in addition to mental and  physical and  and emotional problems that make it a pipe dream to go out and connect with the world.  i've been living this way for several years now and  but somewhere in the isolation and  i received the good news.  prayer and bible reading have been my greatest comforts as i try to get my bearings in this dark place i find myself in and  but the prayers of an unwashed wretch prefer me are probably not very convincing.  please pray for my protection and direction and  thank you. 
i live atlantic mackerel,why not add offal to your diet.  it is tasty if you get it fresh and cook it right .  way cheaper than meat and contains lots of vitamins and minerals that you might lack due to your limited diet.     where i live atlantic mackerel is about $6/kg or about $4/pound and its shipped halfway across the world from norway.  get some fish in your diet you need the omega 3s.  it tastes pretty good grilled with soy sauce.    also spices are packed with micronutrients and make your food taste awesome.     for potatoes/fruit etc eat the skin if you do not already.  all the good stuff is in the skin.     i think you already recognise that getting micros are going to be an issue looking at your limited list and you might develop vitamin/mineral deficiencies in the long run.  i am pretty frugal but i try to mix up what i eat for my health and for my sanity.

i live for the days,i need some introspection and thoughts from others.  i believe i might end up as a neet and  and i would really prefer someone's opinions and maybe help.    i will start off some facts about myself.    i've always been a pretty good student and  from grade school to college.  i had decent amount of friends until the middle of high school and  and noticed myself changing and finding people just too much of a bother to be with later on.  somewhere in between and  i noticed i started breaking away from family and friends circles.    it started alot during the time my father became abusive.  he was always abusive since i was little and  but there was a time near my 8th grade year to 3rd year of high school where he was just more prevalent and obvious with it.  he was emotionally controlling to me and my sister and  and he forced me and my sister watch him beat up my mother.    again and  still not entirely changed during the middle of high school.  i did have quite a few group of friends in high school and  and i was maintaining a high 3. 8 - 3. 9 gpa with honor classes and  and ap classes.  i went out prefer a normal high school student.   sometime in sophmore year and  i had a fight with one of the  girls in school.  this and  along with all the fighting at home with my dad just gave me a headache.  and i just felt it was better having a smaller group of friends.  this is when i stopped alot of my socialization.    my father was becoming especially bad at the time and  and i started cutting out friend groups.  smaller and smaller.  i started hated going outside.  my father would always cause problems when we were outside.  he'd fight with the bus driver and  the person at the grocery store etc.  anyone and  who'd piss him off and  and i started rolling more into myself.  it was better and safer inside and  watching a movie where there would not be any unnecessary crap.   by the end of high school and  i was putting all my effort and energy with school.  i graduated with a high gpa and  and was able to maintain myself in the top 10% of my graduating class with high honors.  but and  i was in total depression and  battling with suicidal thoughts.    my mother finally was deciding to divorce him at this time and  but the damage was already done.    i and  having no idea what to do with my future and  ended up becoming a nurse.  why? because my mom wanted me to become a nurse.  i said  since i was battling depression and  and it was already a big deal for me to get out of bed and  let alone try to think of what i wanted to become for the rest of my life.    i got a full scholarship to college and  went to school.  i hated talking to people and  the only reason i had friends was because people would literally have to come to me to talk.  they'd have to offer and  because i never made any effort.  in fact i probably treated alot of people shitty.  they'd always complain that i was always at home and  that i never went to hang with them.    by this time and  i realized that nursing was not really a field i wanted to be in.  you could imagine and  it had so much socialization that i just was not used to anymore.  and it made me so uncomfortable.  my mom forced me on.    i graduated with a 3. 7 gpa with cum laude.  by the end of college and  i deleted all my social media and  with the exception to tumblr.  i stopped talking to all my college friends.   i only have about 5 friends now and  .    and currently and  i am a 22 year old icu nurse and  hating life.  on my days with work i cringe at every moment i have to deal with doctors and  other nurses and  patients and their families.  when i come home and  i cry because of how mentally exhausted i am with the overload on socialization.  on my days off and  i stay locked up in my room.    i want to quit and  but my mom wont let me.  she keeps asking me how i would support myself and  if i quit my job.    but honestly and  i live for the days i have off.  i prefer sleeping in and being snuggled in my blanket and  watching anime and youtube all day.  i am the happiest just doing that.    i am at the end of my rope.  i honestly and  do not even really know what opinions or comments i want from posting this topic.  but i just wanted to throw my story out there.    thanks for listening
i live in wisconsin,you basically won the lottery with that 14 and 000 a year.  in the us the welfare system is very strict and i live in wisconsin with a conservative governor who makes all these welfare to work laws so if you get welfare you have to go in and do job searches and get hounded by case workers who’s sole job it is to get you off the dole

i live in canada,they were talking about how one of my cousin's going to college should avoid philosophy professors and all cause they'll bring him into atheist dogma and then went into a whole diatribe about absolute truths and what not.   i wanted to debate them but i held back and did not.  i feel a bit ashamed cause i backed off but i do not know if i made the right choice or not.     is this a good precautionary tactic or am i better off being somewhat honest? i live in canada

i live today and not five years from now and so there ' s no point,entry level and  but work gap and  and no reliable transport means i can only and  if i were to even kid myself into doing it and  apply for maybe ten positions near me.  if it takes one hundred apps to get an interview and  that means it will take me ten tries of those places and  but and  you must wait six months.  so and  do the math and  that's prefer four and a half years of waiting and  not counting the first try as a six month period.  i live today and  not five years from now and  so there's no point.  then there's the fact that i do not agree with policies and it kills motivation.  example: temp agencies taking fifteen percent of your money whilst the government takes another ten or fifteen percent and  then items you buy are price gouged after that due to capitalistic corruption and  then things prefer rent are hard to find good deals on and insurance is silly too.  it's all just not worth my time and  if i did succeed and  i would be supporting a world that i wholly do not agree with and  i would be enabling bad behaviors.  if someone wants me to work they can put me to work then pay me and  but they won't because the system is broken to the point of bullshit talking and money walking the fuck away.

i live in fl,and i live in fl.  why do you call yourself smelly? you know taking showers once a day is  a comfort thing and  especially if you're obese.    i usually take a shower every day even though i do not go out.  i get oily way too quickly then get acne also quickly.   oh and  and that picture is three years old you know.  i gained prefer 50 lbs and aged three years.     . and why are your photos removed. 
i live in fl,yes actually and  moving can solve tons and tons of problems.  local laws can ruin your entire life and  and i live in fl so the climate is unlivable too.  i want away from the bible thumping red wingers and am not a people person enough to get weed from random strangers and  so i would want a blue winger legal weed state and  oregon is the only one with good laws as it has laws to protect against drinking being banned and has legalized recreational weed and  and a great climate.  no other states have protection for drinking and legal weed simultaneously.  try living in the south i dare you.  go for a walk in a heat index of over a hundred when a fat man.  fl is one of the worst states and i am not moving to another shitty one.   nothing but old people and heat and shit laws and shitty black and white trash and some of the worst police in the world.     the type of person with your stance is either playing mind games to get people to hate themselves enough to be martyrs or is just plain ignorant to other people's lives.  i can't tell you how much it pisses me off when people spout such nonsense as do not run away from problems when it's a bad area in the context.  you expect me to fucking fix the shitty southern states?   the first thing to do is move when there's trouble and  do not be  a fool.    edit: added a couple ranting paragraphs.    literally running from issues is a logical and valid option.  always has been and always will be.    if you think you're entitled to where you were born you should move out of the us yourself.    edit: also nevada doesn't count because it's one of those weird ones and also red. 
i live in fl,back when people were not abrahamic they had things prefer nude statues and  then later nudity is evil  gay is evil  literally   fun   eeeeevvvviiiillllll  did you take a nap too lon--   evil  pretty simple.   if i use profane words where i live in fl and  i can get arrested and  literally it's banned outside and  because do not curse heathen    edit: the pagans they killed often probably believed in peace and  abrahamic is miltant and says attack the non-believers.  pagans were more fun.    and fringe support and  you're silly.  they killed them when they resisted and  and brothels and other fun things were not outright banned and  they just really needed them to pay the church taxes to pay for their armies and  because and  war mongering religions.

i live in the edge of town in the suburbs and and there ' s a capital city about 20 miles out,i live in the edge of town in the suburbs and  and there's a capital city about 20 miles out.  i am thinking of leaving this morning and just walking there.  not sure why i had that thought and  i guess i am so bored with life it would be an experience at least.  i am thinking about bringing my camera to do some photography along the way.   deciding if i should leave my cell phone at home or not and  what do you think?
i live with my parents and do not have a job,your story sounds really scary and  and made me question my whole entire existence.  sometimes i feel prefer this life is not real.  there are so many strange things about this world we live in and  it's as if i jumped into some other dimension.  global warming pushing past 1c global temperatures and increasing and  plastic in the oceans and  killing off species and  hell and  200 species are going extinct every single day.  we're literally witnessing the sixth mass extinction.  and what am i doing? absolutely nothing.  i live with my parents and do not have a job.  i've been out of a job for over a year now.  there has been no consequence from it.  i feel prefer i am already dead.  no one ever contacts me anymore outside of family.  i feel comfy and  but overwhelming amounts of dread and despair at the same time.  it all feels so unreal.   maybe what you're experiencing is dissociation.  a feeling of detachment from reality.  honestly and  that overdose could have done some damage and  but i am no expert.  you should consider going to the doctor.    but i guess it doesn't matter because the world is ending and  so do whatever you want.  at least and  that's what i keep telling myself.  it's my unhealthy way of coping with things.  life is.  strange.

i live in england,it's quite the journey since i live in england though.  i do use lots of aids for it and  but still not quite there yet.  i do see a specialist and  but i am not sure if they are 'the best' but even if they are the most experienced and  multiple tests won't do any harm.

i live in a small town and have no work experience or skills,i understand your situation about not being able to have real friends because of the conditions of living.  i went through the exact same thing and  my parents were hoarders.  not the extremes you see on tv and  but i could not get to the kitchen without stepping over a multitude of what i would consider garbage.  i've never had anything that would resemble a real friend because i was persistently ashamed of the way my parents lived.  that and i am pretty much a social outcast anyway.  i am a few weeks away from 25 years old and i've done literally nothing.  i feel trapped too.   i believe feeling grateful for what you have is a cop out to stomp out legitimate concerns about what you do not have.  a case of relative privation or something.  yes and  i had a roof over my head and food to eat and  but i did not particularly enjoy cheese sandwiches or cereal for dinner.  and the government housing was not particularly lavish and  the neighborhood kids did not exactly treat me well.   if you can get a job i would say do it.  i do not know if you have any mental inhibitors that would make employment seem prefer the end of days and  so i can't accurately address you here.  i can't imagine that the same destitute existence with no traction will be more enjoyable at 32 than it is at 22 though.  i live in a small town and have no work experience or skills.  i apply everywhere and nobody wants to hire an adult child who has done nothing for the last 7 years.  if i had an opportunity to get a job i would do my best to try to make a change.    realism versus dreams and  haha.  my dreams tell me i want to be a multi-millionaire with no concerns in the world other than to manage my fat stack of money.  reality tells me i would be lucky to get a job most people would scoff at.  i do not have the opportunity to go back to school because my parentstrained' to be anything more than unemployable scum.  i do believe you'll have to develop some form of self-confidence in order to pursue law.  you probably feel as if it's above you and  or you won't follow through with it.  i am not the most well-equipped guy to saycreating your own purpose' and  or pretending that there is one past procreation is just a form of self-delusion or blissful ignorance.    i also ended up rambling and  hope some of what i spent a bit of time typing rings true or is 'encouraging'
i live in a super small town with very little employment opportunities,i am struggling with this hard right now.  i've been a neet for the past 6 years and the harsh reality has crashed onto my head that i am exactly what i did not want to be.  i have zero options.  i live in a super small town with very little employment opportunities.  i've applied everywhere you can think of that somebody with no experience would apply to and have heard nothing back.  i have no direction to turn to.  i have defaulted student loan debt and i've already been excluded from military service.  what's left? i do not want to die but i feel prefer it's the only legitimate option that i have.  i can't get a job and pay for a life and i can't move away without the money to do so.  i am stuck and it eats me alive.

i live in a country where everyone lives in tightly packed apartments and nobody is going to have an acoustic kit in their dwelling because they would get noise complaints,what do you mean by mirroring the top half? just switching the cymbals around? my problem is i can currently drum open handed on right handed sets but i can't comfortably hit the ride and  it's too far from my left hand.  so i just use the crash for both crash and ride and  which doesn't sound all that bad when i am practicing by myself but is probably not something i should keep doing either.    i do not need to worry about having to play acoustic kits for the most part.  i live in a country where everyone lives in tightly packed apartments and  nobody is going to have an acoustic kit in their dwelling because they would get noise complaints.

i live with my boyfriend and two mutual friends,i live with my boyfriend and two mutual friends.  we're all pretty close. my boyfriend is 20/m and  one roommate is 19/m and  and the other is 18/m.  i am 21/f.    my boyfriend works during the day and  waking up at 5:00am and coming home at around 3:30pm.  he goes to bed at 9:00pm.  one of my roommates is on disability.  he's awake until 3:00-4:00am each night and  sleeps until about 2:00pm.  i am not exactly sure when the other roommate sleeps and  but he usually wakes at around 11:00am.   i used to go to sleep at 11:00pm and wake up at 6:00 or 7:00am and  but now i am staying up until 3:00 with the two roommates and am forced to wake up at 5:00am.    i do not think i should be forced to sleep at 9:00pm and  and i do not want to be kept awake until 2:00am.   we are a cohesive group in all ways but this.  any suggestions?   **tl;dr sleep schedules are f'ed in my house and it throws a lot of things off. **  edit: i sleep in a room with my boyfriend and  the other two have their own rooms.  the house is medium-sized but the bedrooms are all off one little hallway.  generally the two boys are walking back and forth from the kitchen to their rooms most of the night and  keeping their lights on and their doors open.  even if i told them to shut their doors and  they would still get hungry during the night just because they f'ed up their eating schedules along with their sleep schedules.  for example and  it's 3:00am and they literally just got back from denny's. 
i live with three other cool people,i am 21/f.  as stated and  i am not employed and  educated and  or in training.  i completed a year of university and it was awful.   every month i get a subsidy from the government for being too autistic to function.  the money sustains all my needs with left over to save up for absolutely nothing because i have no idea what to do with my life.    i've been fired from nearly every job i've ever had-- once because i did not  with the .  all i need right now is structure and  but i won't find it by going back to work.  i have no idea what is required of me in order to keep a job.  it's absolutely baffling to me how anyone can work in the same place for years.    anyways and  i used to provide structure for myself with information.  basically obsessively researching topics i was interested in; self educating.  that was really fun for a while but now i have all this information that's going nowhere and  and i am at a point with my research where it seems prefer i can predict what the content of any textbook is going to be before i open it.  i do not want to find something else to learn because it will end in the same damn thing.    my solution for this was to start a blog and  and that's going okay.  i thought maybe if i could get all this information out to people and  and flavor it with my subjective perspective and  it would be a  creative endeavor that would enrich my existence and  or whatever.  and sure and  .  it's  doing that and  but i have 12 hours or more in each day-- i can't just fill that with blogging.    i live with three other cool people.  i really try and attach myself to the way they exist and  in that i am open to doing basically whatever and we tend to cause a decent amount of entropy as a group and  so it's fun and  but it doesn't really go anywhere.  we've been going to church and creating alter egos at church because of the 'irony' and  and it's retarded and i feel stupid with these people.  in a good way i guess and  but stupidity only gets you so far.    i get out on walks and hikes all the time and  i listen to music and  and i prefer drawing.  i draw every day and  and i think i am pretty good.  i've had my art on a decently popular blog before but nothing came from it and  so i feel prefer it'll also go nowhere.  i draw with a sense of futility which fuels the creativity but ultimately leaves me feeling even deader than when i started and  which means i take a lot of shrooms and drink a lot of coffee.    i've also tried volunteering but i f'd that up as well.  socializing in a setting prefer that and  where there's pressure and obligation to do some activity and  just creates tension.  when i try to release the unbearable tension it invariably completely goes wrong.    i feel prefer i am floating in a vat of time.  i have too much time and nothing to do with it.  my friends are idiots and in the same position.  i am an idiot.  i am so confused about life and everything in it.    therapy is not the answer.  i've been down that road as well.   i do that too ;_;   yeah and  yeah and  i've been sober before and it was awful.  drugs are awful too and  but they're a different  interesting awful.  it's figuratively exactly prefer putting on a pair of orange sunglasses and  becoming enamored with the atmospheric effects of that and  then taking them off again and  and then putting them on as contextual boredom sets in.    i do not know.    **tl;dr pls help**

i live in london and have £6000,i am 23 years old and have been unemployed for 2 years and  things just have not worked out health and career-wise.  i live  in london  and have £6000.  i mainly want to start a business because i want some passive income so that i can focus on self-development and my health.  a few days ago i discovered that it is possible to start a lucrative business by subcontracting and selling handyman services prefer painting or cleaning.  i know nothing about business so i am making this thread to get an overview of the resources and  difficulty and time doing something prefer this would take and whether i have access to these things in order to start my own business in the field.  i also want to know around how many hours would i need to spend managing the business and how much money i would need to put into it.    the things i have going for me is that i currently live with my family who i do not have to pay rent to and  so i have a lot of free time.  i also have £6000 which is about $8000.  the things i do not have going for me is 0 business knowledge and  i cannot drive and have never done any handyman type work.  does it make sense for me to give it a shot or should i consider a different business idea altogether / wait a few years until i have better resources? this is probably the one time in my life where i have this free time and  so i really want to use it to my advantage.

i live with my mom for almost 5 years,here's my neet story.    i've been an outcast since junior high and  high school.  not attractive.  short .  i hate it.  ever since i was 15 or 16 i could not stand my height or looks.  i just do not compare to other guys.  women just do not prefer me.  i had to be overly aggressive and meet many and  many women from online  to have any chance at all.  and when i was given a chance and  it was with 4's and 5's.  i am sure you know what i mean.  spent most of my time online since prodigy and aol back in late93.  liked it more than real people.  went to community college and  majored in the wrong thing and  then onto a 4 year school.  tried to live on campus but the first week was terrible so i just lived at home.  family life was even worse and  negative vibes and  family life falling apart.  did poorly in the wrong major and lost my financial aid.  never really met anyone in college.  i just went to classes and came home.  worked a few entry level jobs while i was out of college and living with my eroding family.  my brother and  who i lived with  bugged me to get a job.  we did not even talk for the last year i lived there.  it was a strange and  negative family vibe.  my family fell apart since the death of my grandmother and my father years before that.  even if i worked and  they would look down on me.  finally moved out and  had few friends and  spent my free time online.  when i went outside and  or to a club and  bar and  i felt nervous and insecure.  could not even go to a mall without feeling afraid.  when i got my confidence up and  i was rejected.  as far as my job - pay was poor and  my expenses were $1200 a month and i was making $1400-$1500 at most.  after a certain age and  you can apply for financial aid and they only count your income and  not your parents and  so i went back to community college.  graduated with a better major and  then went to a private school for 1. 5 years.  got a 4 year degree and  $30 and 000 of college debt and  and started my real career.  i never quite the jobs i wanted and  always an offshoot of my major instead and  or only jobs where they wanted me to do one or two things and  and always got fired within 6 months to 1. 5 years.  however i do have a girlfriend.  i've had the same one since 2006.  guess what? i turned her into a neet as well.  she only had low paying child care and retail jobs.  when i stopped working and  she worked for awhile and then stopped as well.  almost ruined the relationship.  she hated me for not working.  hated me.  and i do not blame her.  i was lost.  anyway and  the last time i got fired and  i was devastated and  and did not want to work again.  just sick and tired of getting fired and going to jobs i did not prefer.  obama extended the funemployment for 2-3 years so i relaxed.  i tried to teach myself web development but it's difficult and trying to build some website is even harder.  when the funemploment ran out and  i was even fatter and  more overweight and  and more of a recluse than before.  i got evicted from my overpriced apartment.  lived on my own from 2000 to 2013 and  spending over $110 and 000 on rent over those years and having nothing to show for it.  my girlfriend also lived with me the last few years but she got sick of working as well and  and moved back home.  but we still stayed together.  she went back to college and  for something that's not in demand and  and now she still can't find a job and doesn't want to do retail or any of that so she lives at home.  i live with my mom for almost 5 years.  i surf online and  play xbox one and  go to amusement park during the summer and  go on day walks and  go see movies with moviepass and  and re-study my major so i can get a job  and put my life back together.  my mom gives me some money each month.  pathetic and  i know.  the strange thing is my relationship has improved because we do not fight prefer we did when we lived together and  and time has made us appreciate having each other because we do not have much else.  it's a very strange friendship/relationship.  anyway and  i was such a recluse that i would not go to the eye doctor and  dentist and  or anything to get things i needed done.  thankfully and  things have been better in 2017 and in early 2018.  i went to the eye doctor and  got checked out and  eyes healthy and  new glasses.  also finally overcame my fear and went to the dentist.  my teeth have always been bad.  when i got my braces off and  i had stains all over.  the orthodontist said some really mean and degrading things to me and  and that hurt my self confidence too.  so i stayed away from people.  anyway and  i went to the dentist and got a cleaning and  4 teeth pulled and  etc.  not in pain anymore.  the medicaid really saved me.  affording a partial or implants and  that's another thing i can only solve when i get a job.  now and  i am trying to work up the confidence to go see a doctor and get a checkup and  because i've been having a few issues over the past several years and  but i am embarrassed and afraid to go.  but i have to overcome this fear.  i have so much fear about the doctor and  that i even do not prefer my blood pressure taken.  i feel violated and strange.  when they took it at the dentist and  before they pulled a tooth and  i was so nervous and freaking out and  and almost passed out.  but then after that and  3 other times i went went to the dentist and got my blood pressure taken it was normal and i was not afraid.  so i overcame a weird fear.  anyway and  my plan is to hit the doctor and  overcome this fear and  and then the final thing i will have left is to get a job and start my life again.  oh and  i've also used this down time to fix my credit.  it was horrible and  with prefer 9 collections and  no credit card and  nothing.  now i have 2 credit cards and  and only 5 collections since a few fell off.  doing nothing and waiting is a great plan to fix my credit.  but i did default on my federal loan and  even though i paid off my six private loans.  so there's that to deal with.  basically things just overwhelmed me and  so i quit doing anything.  i am 40 .  my girlfriend is 32.  been a neet for over 7 years.  and since my girlfriend has become a neet and  i guess this is prefer a virus.  we're both trying to get our lives back together.  but we're two outcasts.  oh and  and i do have more friends than before and  but they're basically all living at home and  or working some retail job.  the classes of people truly do stick together.  sorry for the long post.

i live in europe,i am an american but i live in europe now.  there are certainly things europe does a lot better and  prefer health care.  but to say there is not cultural diversity in america is ridiculous.  name one aspect of culture that you think america is lacking in.   and  and  the suburban sprawl is not a matter of culture and  it's a matter of geography.  european towns look the way they do because they've been inhabited far longer and are more densely populated and  since european nations had far less living spaces to expand to than america which stretched from ocean to ocean.  suburbs were started because people wanted larger houses and the increasing availability of cars made it possible to live further from one's work place.  it has nothing to do with culture or sophistication and  that's geography. 
i live in a big city full of refugees and i spot a burka once a day at most among thousands of people i pass and and i think i ' ve only seen a full face veil 3 or 4 times in the entire time i ' ve been here,do you live in germany?   i do.  i am an american who moved here.  part of moving here and  naturally and  was learning german and  and in my german classes i've met a lot of refugees.   most of them are either entirely secular or not even devout muslims - a lot of them drink alcohol and  many of the women do not even wear hijabs.  i've spent a lot of time talking to normal people who are not unlike germans or americans i know.  they watch the same tv shows and movies and  they wear the same clothes and  and the only  committed by a refugee i've personally met is smoking some weed.  i live in a big city full of refugees and i spot a burka once a day at most among thousands of people i pass and  and i think i've only seen a full face veil 3 or 4 times in the entire time i've been here.   my german wife used to directly work with refugees.  she found almost all of them to be courteous and  thankful and  and motivated.  i know a lot of germans and none of them think the way you do.    there are germans who do think the way you do and  mostly afd supporters and  but they are not the majority here.   yes and  there are a few scumbags who are rapists or killers and  just prefer you'd get out of any large group of people anywhere on this planet.  but you can't leave millions of people to die in a war zone.  germany has certainly taken in a lot and taking in such a large amount of people makes it harder to detect the dangerous ones.  but the only reason germany has taken in so many is because most other countries have not stepped up.  america has almost 4 times the population of germany and has only accepted a few thousand refugees.    i would also point out that not all refugees are muslims.  there are christian refugees too and  and quite a lot of nonreligious people as well.  i've seen a few people raised in islam come out as atheists.  syria and  compared to other countries in the middle east and  was a rather progressive and pluralist society before the civil war began.  and most of the radical islamists are still in syria fighting for their ideology there.

i live in canada,i majored in psychology and i live in canada.  as for what type of work i prefer to do and  it's very difficult to answer because i have very limited experience and unless i've actually done something and  it's tough for me to say if i would prefer to do it and be good at it for sure.    i do feel prefer i would be better suited for doing something prefer reading books/texts or analyzing large amounts of data or language for errors and  but i have no idea how i would be able to get a job prefer that and  or how i would even begin pursuing that.  even if i went back to school i feel prefer i would have to start applying for jobs online again and get rejected over and over again. 
i live in canada and it does n ' t seem to be as difficult to get disability here as it is in the usa,i live in canada and it doesn't seem to be as difficult to get disability here as it is in the usa.  i know of a few people with asperger's who were able to get disability and  and they seem to be about as high functioning as i am.   as for family judging me and  i am not too worried about that.  i am an only child so my only family is basically my parents and  and they are actually very supportive of me no matter what i decide to do.  they know that i've spent years of my life trying to be a productive member of society  and  and they actually think it's a good idea for me to try to get disability benefits.

i live in canada too and and dealing with the really cold weather for nearly half the year sure does n ' t seem to help my depression either,i also have asperger's which is definitely another issue preventing me from going to south korea.  i feel prefer i would be too socially awkward to travel to a new country by myself and interact with new people.  i have also been diagnosed with adhd and  but it doesn't seem to effect me too much and  i think it might have been a misdiagnosis.   anyway and  i personally think that going to spain would be a really good idea for you if you could find a teaching job.  you've been to europe on your own already and  it doesn't sound prefer it would even be that much out of your comfort zone to go back.    i can relate to quite a bit of what you are going through and  all i can say is i really hope things eventually work out for you the best that can be expected.  i live in canada too and  and dealing with the really cold weather for nearly half the year sure doesn't seem to help my depression either.  at least it's summer now so i seem to be in a better mood.
